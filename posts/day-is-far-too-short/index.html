    <h1 id="dayisfartooshort">Day Is Far Too Short</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Been keeping this to myself, but I've always felt that I operated on a 27-hour cycle rather than the standard 24. Seriously, I could use the extra three. It'll fix my sleep schedule, and I won't go to bed thinking about all the things I wanted to do but didn't have the time for.</p>
    <p>I'm hesitant in sharing this because I know plenty of people who view the opposite, usually those with depression or general apathy. When I was first introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">spoon theory</a>, it made me completely reevaluate the processes behind motivation. I learned that motivation was something I took for granted. And to take it further, I learned that not everyone was driven to finish tasks as efficiently as possible; a good number of people struggle maintaining their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions">executive functions</a>, which can sometimes lead to self-neglect.</p>
    <p>I sympathize with this. But, I find I have no basis in explaining or discussing these mental states, as I've never performed deep research into the topic or experienced it myself. To put it more succintly, I lack the credentials.</p>
    <p>And I certainly feel terrible taking a U-turn and talking about the oppositeâ€”in that I expect myself to do too much within a certain amount of time, and get irritated when I fail to satisfy those impossible conditions.</p>
    <p>I relieve this dissonance by reminding myself this is a space for my thoughts. I tend the garden and plant the seeds.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless: the Day Is Far Too Short.</p>
    <p>I like doing things. I get impatient about it sometimes, which prompts me to remind myself of <a href="/posts/consider-the-long-run">the long run</a>. Time, for me, is simultaneously an ally and an obstacle. It's an obstacle in that I might need to spend years working towards a single goal (conducting research in AI safety), yet it's an ally in that I have <em>all the time in the world</em> to do so. And, given time, I can learn to appreciate the value of patience.</p>
    <p>I recently acquired <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence">Superintelligence</a></em> by Nick Bostrom, and as I was flipping through it, I started thinking about how I would approach the material. Do I want to skim through it first? Should I annotate? How many pages can I read per day before I hit information overload? (Related: <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/reading-books-vs-engaging-with-them/">Reading books vs. engaging with them</a>).</p>
    <p>Then I started wondering about how <em>fast</em> I can read it. Should I start skipping paragraphs when they don't interest me? Should I skip boring chapters completely? It's a 324 page book; can I trust myself to finish it within two weeks while retaining a decent amount of crystallized knowledge?</p>
    <p>This is a dangerous road to wander down. At some point, I started acknowledging the <a href="https://static3.bigstockphoto.com/3/5/3/large1500/3531022.jpg">signs</a> and considered an oppositional thought: what is the <em>purpose</em> in reading quickly?</p>
    <p>A: Interesting question. I suppose it's so I can read more books?</p>
    <p><em>Q: Why?</em> </p>
    <p>A: To gain more knowledge!</p>
    <p><em>Q: But shouldn't you focus more on good learning rather than learning as much as possible? In other words, you ought to value understanding rather than simply </em>knowing<em>. Jack of all trades, master of none, etc. etc.</em></p>
    <p>A: That is true, and I agree with the fact that useful knowledge is always better than knowledge that comes in a huge, garbled mess. I guess one of my consistent faults is a nagging impatience to achieve whatever I want as quickly as possible, never breaking to smell the flowers. I'll take that into account for the future.</p>
    <p><em>Q: What's up with the title?</em></p>
    <p>A: <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/%EC%A0%84%EC%9E%90%EC%96%91/day-is-far-too-long/">Ref</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Q: Should I listen to it?</em></p>
    <p>A: I think you should.</p>
    <p><em>Q: Can I go now?</em></p>
    <p>A: Of course.</p>
    <p><em>Q: Bye!</em></p>
    <p>A: Bye!</p>
