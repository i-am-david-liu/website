    <p>I was digging deep into AI safety prerequisites today, and I stumbled upon <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/naJ9cJfHMTJ9CACvD/getting-started-independently-in-ai-safety">this forum post</a>.</p>
    <p>The OP introduced a method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_learning">just-in-time learning</a>, which advocated solving problems / misunderstandings <em>when they arise</em>, rather than spending weeks or months prepping a solid foundation. The post also noted that <em>doing</em> (e.g. working on a project) was already highly coupled with <em>learning</em>, so why not jump into a project faster than you can handle? </p>
    <p>I find this advice useful, mainly because it attacked a belief I never stopped to evaluate. Just-in-time learning runs counter to my present habit of <a href="/posts/chasing-the-dragon">consuming things meticulously and with great care</a>, and I realized that although my one-thing-at-a-time procedure worked great at taming content, it's not so great at <em>learning</em>. I had conflated <em>content</em>, the funny colors on your TV, with <em>knowledge</em>, the stuff that rumbles around your brain. And I felt I needed to fix that, or at least acknowledge I made a mistake.</p>
    <p>Over the past few weeks, I've accumulated a decent backlog of things to read. Notice how I say <em>to</em> rather than <em>want to</em>; through some unconscious mechanism, I had relegated learning to a procession of tasksâ€”the same experience I sought to disentangle from college. I was shocked (and slightly ashamed) when I realized how coldly I approached learning. Where was the fun? Where was the intrigue? The most recent "cool thing" I learned was that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW5gFiJb-ig&list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq&index=5">neural networks can be represented as a sequence of affine transformations</a> (watch 2:00-8:00 if you're interested), and I can't immediately think of any examples which came before it.</p>
    <p>Most of things I wanted to read were longform blog posts, but I'd say about 20% of them were papers. Some of the papers are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf">57 pages long</a>, while others sit at an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12871.pdf">accessible 12</a>. My initial plan, which I now have the right to label "stupid", was to pick one at random, digest it, take notes, and move on to the next.</p>
    <p>In the forum post I referred to earlier, OP advised that reading papers sequentially wasn't the best strategy. Instead, they proposed "[reading] with the intention of getting distracted". The reasoning behind this is to allow you to find what is <em>most interesting to you in that moment</em>, as you'll care more about whatever you're reading rather than approaching it as a thing to conquer.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in putting this into practice. I think it makes more sense to follow the path of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">steepest descent</a> rather than mapping out the territory yard by yard. But I also have to be careful not to fall into sensation-seeking patterns, causing me to hop from one paper to the next in search of more satisfying ideas.</p>
    <p>Another point OP made was not to take notes while reading papers; instead, one ought to write down questions, misunderstandings, and disagreements about the text. I agree with the idea behind writing down questions, but I'm not fully convinced note-taking is an anathema (they compare notes to exam prepwork, which only acknowledges one possible function of note-taking). I find that notes help me summarize the big ideas, and I don't have to trudge through 20 pages of 10-point font just to find the idea I'm looking for.</p>
    <p>Overall, I'm grateful for that post. It gave me a reason to stop and reflect on what I'm doing. The earlier I can experiment with different methods, the faster I can cherry pick the ones that work the best; after that, I expect most of it to be fine-tuning.</p>
    <p>I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
