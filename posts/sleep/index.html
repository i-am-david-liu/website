    <p>I wrote a little program to visualize my sleeping habits. The data is held in a Google Sheet, and the program is written in Python3. The graph is generated with <code>matplotlib</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
    <p>Back in 2021, I read a few articles on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">quantified self</a>. The quantified self is to treat one's lifestyle as a numbers game, usually supplemented by analysis or optimization. This isn't exactly how I wanted to direct my life, but I was interested in tracking <em>something</em>, just to see how it would develop long-term.</p>
    <p>I knew I liked staring at the sleep tracker on my phone, but it wasn't very accurate as it assumed I would fall asleep before a set bedtime. So, I started tabulating my sleep and wake times on September 21, 2021.</p>
    <h3 id="results">Results</h3>
    <p>Here's my chart for 2021, starting on September 21:

    Nice, only one day where I slept before midnight. But as a student, what can I say?</p>
    <p>I also calculated some bonus statistics on the side. The shortest sleep during this time period was 5 hours and 45 minutes, on December 30. The longest sleep was 10 hours and 40 minutes, which actually occurred three times in December.</p>
    <p>On average, I fell asleep at 2:21 AM and woke up at 10:38 AM. But, I got about 8 hours and 17 minutes of sleep per day, which is healthy, I think. If I ever move to California, I would adjust very easily.</p>
    <p>Now here's my chart for 2022, up to July 16 (can you guess when I started my 9 to 5?):
    <img src="/posts/sleep/images/sleep_2022.png" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
    My shortest sleep was 3 hours, on June 18, and the longest sleep was 10 hours and 25 minutes, once in March and the other in April. On average, I slept 8 hours and 4 minutes per day. I'm pretty satisfied with that length.</p>
    <p>One interesting observation was that my sleeping habits appeared periodic. For a few weeks I would sleep super late, then ease back into earlier hours. I'm not sure why this happens.</p>
