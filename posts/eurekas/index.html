    <p>I used to hate history. I thought it was just a regurgitation of facts that served no practical purpose other than recollection and analysis.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until 2018 did I start to appreciate the past—an appreciation that was fostered by an <em>extremely</em> engaging teacher. The eureka moment was noticing how often history seemed to repeat itself (war, discrimination, economic inequality) and recognizing the agents that brought our institutions into power. All of a sudden, history <em>mattered</em>. My invisible questions on race, social hierarchies, political systems, and society were drudged up and exposed to a floodlight, and for the first time in my life I felt a powerful connection to the world around me.</p>
    <p>This was a formative transition during my teenage years, but I think age is an independent variable. Formative transitions can happen anytime in your life. What matters is the <em>eureka moment</em>—the idea or set of ideas that get the ball rolling. No one seeks out a <em>eureka</em>; the eureka finds them.</p>
    <p>To sponge up potential eurekas, one has to be open to the case. If you're avoiding a particular topic or field or idea, think long and hard about <em>why</em>. What part doesn't interest you? Have you done any in-depth research at all, or did you scan the surface and hastily conclude it "wasn't your thing"?</p>
    <p>I used to hate poetry. I enjoyed reading, but poetry didn't make sense to me. Why was the text structured in verses? Who cares about meter? I wasn't a big Shakespeare buff for those reasons, especially when combined with antiquated, hard-to-comprehend language.</p>
    <p>A few years later, I picked up <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2376086.Poems_of_the_Late_T_ang">Poems of the Late T'ang</a></em>, translated by A. C. Graham. I doubted the text would make an impact at all, but I was still curious about how I'd perceive such content after years of silent aversion towards poetry.</p>
    <p>The poems were awesome. I finished the entire thing.</p>
    <p>In contrast to the works of Shakespeare, which focused on the musicality of language, the collected poems by Graham focused on raw imagery and illustration. This happened to be up my alley, and I gained a new appreciation for poetry because of it.</p>
    <p><em>Poems of the Late T'ang</em> was my eureka moment for poetry. But I didn't seek it out <em>knowing</em> it would be a eureka; I had no idea if I would enjoy it. What I did do was keep an open mind and deliberately visit content I felt sure to despise. I wanted to challenge my beliefs, and in return, I was rewarded with a newfound curiosity.</p>
