    <p>I wrote a post every day for the month of January, and I think it was so demanding that it wiped me out for six months. But I don't regret doing it; it was a nice little experiment with zero loss.</p>
    <p>My plan for the future is to get back into the habit of writing something and putting it up on the internet. I'd say there's about a 55% chance of this happening for real. There's a lot of things I want to talk about, but crystallizing all those jumbled thoughts feel like pure labor.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, I've been reading tons and tons. I've read 13 books this year (this is big for me!), not counting all the papers and articles and Substack posts I devour every morning. Sometimes I wonder if I could use my time more wisely. Like, vacuum the stairs or whatever.</p>
