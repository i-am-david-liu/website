    <p>Nostalgia relies on past memories, spanning a period of time where such memories no longer occupy the day-to-day thought cabinet. One can <em>only</em> experience nostalgia when they have the history to do so. Children don't feel nostalgia for that reason; they have nothing to recollect. But adults are particularly prone to this feeling, rewinding time to visit an old video game, or their childhood house, or an uncontacted friend. Nostalgia is like a reward for remembering things, a time capsule which buries itself. We're nostalgic for good things that have passed and passed away. The raw material is replayed in our mind, and sometimes we try to emulate it as best as we can, but our bodies have grown, and our minds got too serious, and future anxieties always come crawling back to ruin the whole thing.</p>
    <p>For those who are very, very old—stringy white hair and skin like drought lines—nostalgia feels like a bullet. Memories and experiences lasso'd from the long-lost decades; faces refined, images clarified, letters of a forgotten name pieced together like a spinning slot machine. Nostalgia gains power as the years fly by. A yearning for the past decade crumples under the weight of yearning fifty years before.</p>
    <p>This is why I think the elderly tend to lock you into their stories. When very, very old people tell stories, they're part of the audience, too. The speed at which you listen is close to the speed of their recollection, like running a marathon side-by-side. Every sentence feels like a lightbulb to them. To interrupt them is to halt their nostalgia. And to have all those years behind you, all those interactions and experiences and insights lying dormant in an overstuffed mind; it feels unbearable to me. I wonder how they manage.</p>
