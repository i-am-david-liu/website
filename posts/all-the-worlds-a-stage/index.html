    <p>Another one of those things that seem so obvious, but you fall into the trap anyway.</p>
    <p>When I see strangers in suits with tight hair projecting a harmless smile they perfected down to the micromuscle, I can't help but think, "Oh, they must be prudes." And they might be. But I've had too many experiences where the suit is just a convention, and behind that carefully maintained graphic is an anxious college grad who spent their last Sunday watching four movies back to back to back to back.</p>
    <p>I'm not dissing suits, and I'm not dissing people who chose this display. The purpose is to remind myself (and whoever's reading this) that we all play a part in the exchange. We maintain ideals <em>in search</em> for ideals. And more often than not, our true selves are not even close to what's being projected. This is why companies conduct interviews—they're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">pentesting</a> our projections to expose what's hidden beneath.</p>
    <p>But behind forced smiles and half-hearted applications, we're all just people, from the interviewer to the interviewee. Your boss is just a person. Your boss's boss is just a person. Bill Gates is just a person (albeit a person with tremendous amounts of capital). I tend to neglect this a lot, and I often compare myself to those who share their successes more often than I do with memes. No, I'm not rallying against the "system", whatever that means. I merely think it's helpful to take a step back and wonder if Robert Schmobert (PhD) really does spend half his waking life talking about "Next-Gen AI Healthcare Startups 2023", while in reality his favorite food is a potato chip sandwich, and he can gush about Deep Space Nine for as long as the candle burns.</p>
    <p><a href="/posts/theres-something-about-proverbs">"Don't judge a book by its cover,"</a> as they say. You can probably sum up this post with that one line.</p>
    <p>But I noticed even after flipping through the pages, our mental models are probably still wrong. You can't "solve" people; that system is too complex. And some parts are straight up inaccessible unless you really, <em>really</em> pry. The problem with traits and flaws is we likely have no idea what the intentions are behind them. Is someone nice because they genuinely care about being good, or do they see niceness as social mobility? We'll never know.</p>
    <p>I'd like to give up judgments completely. Sure, Schmobert (PhD) might be easy to characterize <em>in the moment</em>, but traits and flaws are local variables. Who knows what kind of person he'll be after his 6-month sabbatical from West Virginia to Japan?</p>
    <p>People are people are people are people—I need to rehearse this every day for the rest of my life, because it's true. Our exterior models say nothing about the pulleys and gears that rattle beneath. But ultimately, we're all just made out of pulleys and gears.</p>
