    <hr>
    <p>I want to make a case: when one isn't burdened by goals, time constraints, or product releases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel">reinventing the wheel</a> is a valuable activity. Building something from the ground up is a great way to understand the intuition behind a concept. Once you develop a gears-level model of a system, that knowledge sticks with you far longer than superficial input-output reasoning.</p>
    <p>"Reinventing the wheel" carries a negative connotation because it's often applied to situations that value <em>results</em> rather than knowledge acquisition or enjoyment. If a Python software engineer is tasked with web-scraping some odd corner of the Internet, their first instinct wouldn't be, "How do I write a parser?" Instead, they might execute <code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code> and get on with it.</p>
    <p>A software engineer working for Tech Inc. most likely has a deadline to meet. But what happens to the notion of "reinventing the wheel" when they don't?</p>
    <p>We tend to call this "leisure", or "free time". Learning on your own free time is an unspoken comfort. There are no semesters, no exams, and you can spend as much time on a project as you wish. "Reinventing the wheel" becomes less of an economic futility and more of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_art">process art</a>, where the journey matters more than the destination.</p>
    <p>But the question remains: <em>why</em> should one reinvent the wheel? In order to answer this, let's consider a tale.</p>
    <h3 id="theparableofthehammerenjoyer">The parable of the hammer enjoyer</h3>
    <p>The vast majority of things were built with purpose. Take a look at this claw hammer:</p>
    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Claw-hammer.jpg" alt="hammer" /></p>
    <p>The design of a claw hammer has evolved over centuries. In the previous picture, I want you to question <em>why</em> the hammer looks that way. Why is the face circular? Why does the hammer have a claw? Why is the handle so flat and skinny? Why does the grip have those wavy lines?</p>
    <p>These were all solutions to sub-problems that have been "patched" from history. Those wavy lines help prevent your palm from slipping. The claw is a convenience that can "redo" a hammer's prime purpose, which is to drive nails. The face is circular because circles have less surface area than, say, square faces, generating more force on impact. (Confession: I don't actually know why the handle looks that way. If you do, send me an email!)</p>
    <p>Point being, the claw hammer we see now is an <em>ideal form</em>, similar to the wheel. Not many people try to improve it because it's at the best it can be. Although there are many brands of claw hammers, if you put them side by side and squint your eyes, they all essentially follow the same design.</p>
    <p>Now consider someone who <em>really digs</em> the concept of hammersâ€”a <em>hammer enjoyer</em>. The hammer enjoyer wants to learn more about hammers, but surprise! No one keeps track of the history of hammers, because no one cares. (Tongue-in-cheek; don't take that literally.)</p>
    <p>The hammer enjoyer knows what a hammer <em>should</em> look like, but they don't know <em>why</em>. So they start thinking of ways to learn this information.</p>
    <p>After a few hours, they settle on a strategy: they'll build a hammer from scratch. They gather some wood (it's easier to shape than metal) and they start cutting it in a shape that resembles their own mental model of a hammer.</p>
    <p>By tomorrow morning, the hammer is finished. Our hammer enjoyer tests it out by banging on some nails, but they quickly realize they made a terrible mistake. The mistake, as you may have already guessed, is that the hammer <em>isn't heavy enough</em> to drive the nails in. Even worse, on a particularly forceful strike, the wooden hammer snaps in half!</p>
    <p>The hammer enjoyer is now back at square one. But this time, they gained some new knowledge: <em>wood is too brittle for hammers</em>. So, they make their next hammer out of steel.</p>
    <p>The steel hammer works great; the metal is strong enough not to break in two, and heavy enough to put nails through with ease. But here comes another problem: the grip isn't that great. Unlike wood, steel is a lot sleeker, and it's hard to maintain a grip when the handle's covered in sweat. The hammer enjoyer iterates again, but this time, they add a rubber grip.</p>
    <p>Over the course of several months, the hammer's design rapidly improves. The face is beveled off, the claw is made sharper, the grip is etched with wavy lines, etc. Through trial and error, the hammer enjoyer now has an ideal model of their favorite tool. It's also apparent that their process sort of resembles the hammer's evolution through history. By reinventing stages of the hammer through time, they understand <em>why</em> some parts were shaped the way they were. These deep insights are particularly powerful when it comes to learning things. The hammer enjoyer has gained the ability to see every individual part of the system working in unison rather than the outline of the system by itself.</p>
    <h3 id="whatthismeans">What this means</h3>
    <p>In summary:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Reinventing the wheel forces you to encounter subproblems that explain how and why the wheel was built in the first place.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I think this is the key for learning anything at a deep level. I feel we learn the most by applying our knowledge, whether through organizing projects or answering questions. There needs to be two-way engagement; else, it becomes trivia.</p>
