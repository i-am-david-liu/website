    <h1>Chasing the dragon</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I noticed a pattern when I get impatient.</p>
    <p>By impatient, I mean a sudden lack of motivation for a task I was previously motivated to do. It's like asking yourself, "I'm bored of this, I want something else." And then you ask it again later when the new stimulus has been exhausted. And again, and again, and again, and again…</p>
    <p>We regard this as low attentional capacity, and it typically isn't something you want. With screens and digital interconnectivity and all, it's become threateningly ubiquitous, and we fought back with things like meditation and mindfulness and a whole slew of research on impulse control, reward pathways, etc.</p>
    <p>I like reading about what motivates us, because I value doing and making things. But I haven't read anything that equated low attention span to <em>maximizing reward</em>. In other words, inattentiveness is due to our brains actively searching for greater doses of reward, even when the current reward is more than satisfactory.</p>
    <p>From an AI perspective, we've become <strong>reward hackers</strong>—prioritizing our utility function (what makes us feel pleasure) over the developer's intent (what we wish to accomplish). In this case, we've become blinded by neurotransmitters that can't tell the difference between love and heroin. It's pleasure all the way down.</p>
    <h3 id="efficientbutnotoptimal">Efficient, but not optimal</h3>
    <p>Our propensity to chase the Next Big Hit is embedded in our biology. Turns out, the dopamine pathway worked really well at keeping us fed (sodium, fat, sugar) as well as maintaining population levels (the F-word, present tense). But it worked a little <em>too well</em> when we systematically developed ways to generate dopamine, like through aesthetics and entertainment. And the manufacturing drugs; don't forget those sneaky imps.</p>
    <p>When I internalized the ability to make long-term plans, which was probably some time in high school, I gradually started to notice how many <em>sources</em> of dopamine were present in our lives. I bet most of you have a computer hooked up to the internet, plus a phone that can pretty much do what your computer does but fun-sized. And some of you might have streaming services full of hundreds of TV shows and movies, all on demand. There's more to list, but let's take a step back and realize how <em>crazy</em> it is that we're able to say, "I am going to autonomously watch an episode of Seinfeld at 3:30 pm tomorrow," and have it reside within the realm of possibility. Think about it. (Ok, maybe you wouldn't say that exact sentence in real life, but you can still derive meaning from absurdity.)</p>
    <p>All these sources, all these <em>choices</em>! We will never be as excited as a 19th-century laborer watching a play from a hole in the wall, no matter how many episodes we binge.</p>
    <p>Instead, we've grown to accept the persistence of content, and we can now <em>choose</em> the content we want instead of cherishing whatever we're handed.</p>
    <p>Consider the newspaper, pre-internet: what's written is what you get. If you're not satisfied with today's news, sure, you can always buy another newspaper, but that might take more effort than it's worth. I'd imagine most people during this time would just wait for tomorrow's issue.</p>
    <p>In the present day, "another newspaper" is equivalent to "typing the name of the newspaper in the search bar and pressing enter." We went from leaving the house to mashing buttons on a keyboard, and the latter scenario is also up-to-date. By, like, <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking">a <em>really</em> wide margin</a>.</p>
    <p>The freedom to choose what we consume is an ideal; I won't argue that. But the more choices we're given, the higher our expectations climb. We're not satisfied with the present anymore. Instead, we glimpse into the near-future, into the realm of possible actions, and we think to ourselves, "Is this <em>really</em> the best I can get?"</p>
    <p>Then we start jumping around. This happened—happen<em>s</em>—to me a lot. I engage in Stimulus A, and it feels great, but then I start eyeing Stimulus B who's folded neatly in the corner, and I'm thinking about how cool and fun Stimulus B is, so I give up on A and switch to B. It's only efficient. But it's not necessarily optimal.</p>
    <p>If I continue this hopping charade, moving from B to C to G to X, I won't get anything meaningful done. I'd be a ship drifting with the wind, with no destination; no captain.</p>
    <p>And if I'm a person who values doing and making things, jumping around conflicts with my desire to, well, do and make things. It's not satisfying at all, at least not for me.</p>
    <h3 id="whatistarteddoinginstead">What I started doing instead</h3>
    <p>I stick with it. I do one thing at a time, and I do it with cognizance. I shutter away the realm of possible choices, cover the blinking lights with a drape, and I focus on what's in front of me. Even when I <em>know</em> there's something better and/or more pleasurable that I could be doing.</p>
    <p>The truth is, the marginal gains from one pleasure to another are often less than nil. I <em>know</em> Seinfeld is funny (frankly, it's an objective truth), and maybe what I'm watching now isn't as funny as Seinfeld, but it's worth an attempt to stick with what I've got, just for a little longer. Who knows: I might be surprised later on.</p>
    <p>And the thing with boredom is we can't be sure if we're truly understimulated, like when we visit our friendly neighborhood DMV, or if our expectations have been dragged to a global maximum and the only thing that'll even remotely stimulate us is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirehead_%28science_fiction%29">wireheading</a>.</p>
    <p>So I urge everyone to consider lowering their expectations of what they consume instead of raising them. The way I attempted to do this was through reading books. Over the summer of 2021, after eight years without a consistent reading habit, I challenged myself to read <em>Walden</em>. It took me two, long months.</p>
    <p>It felt like an accomplishment, though, to finish something so pensive and linguistically antiquated. So I started reading a bit more, consciously choosing books that would interest me rather than intimidate, as <em>Walden</em> did. After taking 2022 into account, I'd say I consistently read about one book per month. I think that's a great improvement.</p>
    <p>Closer: The less we demand from content, the more content we're able to appreciate. It's only optimal.</p>
