    <p>On average, I sleep from 1:30 AM to 9:30 AM. It's skewed, but consistent; I think forming a consistent sleep habit is step one. Choosing to align your schedule with social norms / circadian rhythms is (an optional?) step two, yet I've heard strong arguments from the pro- and anti- contingencies, strong enough that I can't decide which to picket for.</p>
    <p>I sleep late and wake late (compared to the population), but I don't have trouble re-adjusting my schedule when needed. Think of it as a super mild version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder">delayed sleep phase disorder</a>, although I don't like considering it as a disorder at all.</p>
    <p>Back in the summer of 2022, I slept from midnight to 8:00 AM, averaging. The transition wasn't chronic, but I always felt this nagging feeling behind my brain that said something didn't feel right.</p>
    <p>On weekends during this period, I'd switch back to a 2:00 AM - 10:00 AM schedule. It's become my equilibrium state. I gravitate towards it.</p>
    <p>Common knowledge says younger people tend to sleep later than their older counterparts. My expectations for the future regard my current sleep patterns as a phase; once I enter my 40's or something adjacent, I might end up becoming an early riser. Who knows? Beliefs change rapidly when you're open to them.</p>
    <p>A few reasons why I think I sleep this way:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I have no wake-time obligations (I recently graduated and I'm catching my breath to live a little). Because of this, I naturally slip into what my body and brain prefers.</li>
    <li>I strongly lean towards night life over "day life". The air feels cleaner; crisper. Fuzzy golden lamps bathe the streets and restaurants like little suns. Everyone's relaxed. I'm relaxed. And I love the sound of crickets and owls.</li>
    <li>I feel most creative at night, so whatever weird art project I've taken on ends up spilling into the wee hours of the morn. I have trouble letting go of unsatisfied tasks; I hate leaving things half-finished.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My off-kilter sleep schedule reminds me of the push to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/features/schools-start-too-early.html">delay school start times</a> in the U.S. As predicted, many high-schoolers back this idea, while older teachers, especially those with young children, brush it off.</p>
    <p>Waking up during high school was brutal; I would not make future generations live through such a demand. Early rising doesn't imply an early bedtime, either. I had to wake up at 6:00 AM, but I didn't feel tired until close to midnight. That's less than seven hours of sleep for a 16-year old, and I was unable to budge from that schedule for four years.</p>
    <p>Honestly, my mind felt clearer and healthier when I got to college and had more opportunities to choose when I wanted to sleep. College also afforded a "to each their own" type of freedom for me and my peers; some of my friends preferred waking up at 8 or 9, while others slept until noon. A third of our life is spent in bedâ€”but barely any time is spent addressing sleep's subjective needs.</p>
