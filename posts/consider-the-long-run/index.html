    <hr>
    <p>Examining this from two perspectives.</p>
    <h3 id="1thelongrunmakesitmeaningless">1. The long run makes it meaningless.</h3>
    <p>That C- you got? Probably doesn't matter. What matters is how you'll compensate for it. (Plus real-world experience, personal projects, networking, joy of learning, etc.)</p>
    <p>Said a weird thing to a friend? Probably doesn't matter either. If you had a hundred interactions and only one of them was less than positive, that's a 99% friendship success rate. That's a pretty high rate to me. Acknowledge your shortcomings and move on.</p>
    <p>Point being, whatever recent setback you've had <em>generally</em> won't affect your life beyond a scope of a week. It's a local failure.</p>
    <p>When you flip open the news and see Celebrity A being dragged through the headlines because they made an ugly tweet, our first instinct (and certainly mine) might be, "Oh. They're finished."</p>
    <p>Sure—for a couple of weeks. Then, lo and behold, they're announcing a tour, and the tickets are sold out already?</p>
    <p>The more popular you are, the bigger the blast radius. But I'm willing to bet you aren't a movie star or even carry perceptible clout on the internet—you're just a person, like me. And this means our blast radii are on the quantum scale. We ought to be grateful for that.</p>
    <p>The Long Run puts failure in perspective. When we fail enough and often, the impact gets swallowed by everything, everywhere, all at once. At some point, they cease to be failures; they become paper cuts that don't even need a band-aid.</p>
    <h3 id="2thelongrunmakesitmeaningful">2. The long run makes it meaningful.</h3>
    <p>Skipping today's workout? You better be <em>sure</em> you exercise tomorrow.</p>
    <p>In fact, any goal that requires consistent, deliberate practice depends on your conception of the Long Run.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, we're stuck with a funny little chemical called dopamine that might make us dig our own hole, <em>and enjoy the process of doing it</em>. (Conquering my dopamine urges is one of my most important Long Runs. Seriously, I hate this thing!)</p>
    <p>In other words, there's a mile-wide rift between <em>desiring</em> something and successfully <em>acting</em> on that desire. The proverbial analogue of this idea is "it's easier said than done," and I think the statement's reputation is well-deserved.</p>
    <p>I want to make a movie someday. If I start working towards that goal now, I might have an inkling of confidence about six months in, assuming I dedicate myself fully to this ideal.</p>
    <p>But, six months? Just to achieve <em>one</em> desire? That takes so much time!</p>
    <p>I'd tend to agree, if it wasn't for the fact I expect to live, on average, 56 more years (average male lifespan in U.S. - my age relative to this post).</p>
    <p>What's 6 months compared to 56 years? If I <em>were</em> to dedicate myself to filmmaking instead of AI, that half-year slice takes about 0.9% of the rest of my expected life. We probably spend more total time on the loo.</p>
    <p>When we make internal predictions on how long it might take to, say, learn a marketable skill, or get a dream job, or get a six-pack that breaks the Mohs Hardness Scale, we prefer to weigh the predicted costs against more tangible units of time. I'm talking about hours and days.</p>
    <p>It's hard to learn anything useful when restricted to hours and days. In order to accomplish bigger things, we have to consider the Long Run (three months, six months, a year, a decade) and compare it to the Longest Run (the rest of our lives).</p>
    <p>And yes, not everyone is born equal; some have shorter Longest Runs compared to others, whether it be genetics, their environment, or medical acts of God. But for a majority of us, the most we'd have to worry about is a freak car crash.</p>
    <p>And we ought to be grateful for that.</p>
