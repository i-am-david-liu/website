    <p>Yesterday, I made a blueberry pound cake for my father's birthday. It didn't come out right; the center was still wet even after 30 extra minutes of baking. But I still felt I <em>got</em> something out of it.</p>
    <p>This was a from-scratch recipe, and I've only made it once before (some time in the winter of 2022). From that experience, I had learned two things about making pound cake:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure the butter is soft. Never work with cold butter.</li>
    <li>Manual whisking cannot cream butter. (I did not have an electric mixer at the time.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So when I made it again yesterday, I took those observations into account. I waited until the butter was soft, and for creaming I used an electric mixer.</p>
    <p>But the pound cake still came out wrong, even though I felt confident that I "got it right" relative to the first iteration. Turns out, I had mistakenly set the oven to 350 F rather than 325 F, and my guess is the slight increase in temperature cooked the outside much faster than the inside. Even worse, I had stuck the toothpick in a spot that wasn't runny (I think I just got unlucky), strengthening my belief that the cake was done.</p>
    <p>I tossed the cake back in the oven for an extra half hour. The toothpick came out <em>sort of</em> moist afterwards, but by this point it was around 9 pm, so I gave it a whatever. I sliced into it after a 15 minute rest—no more runniness, but it was still wet and undercooked.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, we only ate the sides.</p>
    <p>I regarded this as a <em>failure:</em> I expected a result (a good cake), but instead I got something I didn't want (an undercooked cake). But let's avoid the negative connotations surrounding the word and conceive it in its most literal form: an unexpected, undesirable result.</p>
    <p><em>This post is not a life lesson about failure</em>, despite how much the introduction leans into one. Rather, I will be using failure to talk about <em>proverbs</em>.</p>
    <p>A <strong>proverb</strong> is a short, meaningful, typically metaphorical statement that describes the outcome of an experience.</p>
    <p>For example, a proverb that describes the outcome of my shitty cake might be:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Every cloud has a silver lining."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Great, now I feel like a grandmother. But bear with me; I'm still carving the foundation.</p>
    <p>"Every cloud has a silver lining" is congruent to "bad situations still have positive takeaways". And when applied to my pound cake experience, it's true. Now, I learned two more things about baking pound cakes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Don't mess with the baking time.</li>
    <li>If the pound cake comes out wet, wrap it in foil before baking it again. (I did not wrap it in foil when I attempted to fix it, and only learned after the fact)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If I ever have to make a pound cake a third time, my confidence in doing so would be greater than the confidence I had during my second run, and likewise higher than the first. We tend to forget that failure often eliminates (or at least disincentivizes) the path that leads to it, assuming the navigator has a desire to self-correct. In fact, I argue it's better to traverse or at least predict as many failure paths as possible (a sort of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/murphyjitsu">murphyjitsu</a>) in order to strengthen the winning route.</p>
    <p><em>Q: Ok, so what's the deal with proverbs? Why did you bring it up?</em></p>
    <p>A: Well, the thing about proverbs, at least in my opinion, is that they don't reveal their true insights <em>until the experience they describe has already occurred</em>. Proverbs embody a sort of dual meaning: one that floats near the surface, and another that creeps in the twilight zone waiting for a catch.</p>
    <p>When my pound cake failed even after baking it twice, I was baffled and slightly upset. <em>What did I do wrong?</em> I felt motivated to correct my mistakes, and in the process of doing so, I thought about all the witty sayings and aphorisms that the "old people" lobbed at me when I was kid. I realized many of them, like the silver lining one, were surprisingly useful.</p>
    <p>When I was young, I always understood proverbs as platitudes—statements akin to "it won't matter tomorrow" or "don't cry over spilled milk" (both of which are also proverbs). And because I was a kid, I never thought deeper than the surface interpretation.</p>
    <p>Now, I know what silver linings really mean. Failure <em>is</em> a learning experience. The adults were right!</p>
    <p>On a higher level, I think the reason why proverbs stick with us through time is because they're so readily accessible. The statements neatly embed into our memory regardless of insight, largely because they're rhythmic, succint, and put weird mental images in our heads (what's a gift horse? why can't I look in their mouth?). And when a related experience occurs, they act as catalysts that help us reason with the consequences. At least, it certainly helped me.</p>
    <p>While writing this post, I thought of a few more proverb -&gt; aha! connections:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><em>"One man's trash is another man's treasure":</em> A lot of people thought <em>Snowpiercer (2013)</em> didn't make sense, but I had a blast watching it. </li>
    <li><em>"Don't count your chickens before they hatch":</em> It was common for me to make plans contingent on other plans, even when the latter might not work out (e.g. telling a friend I'll be home by noon even though my carpool told me "we <em>might</em> make it by noon").</li>
    <li><em>"A stitch in time saves nine":</em> (programmer jargon) Better to set and habitualize aliases for common, nontrivial commands rather than Googling the solution or performing <code>history | grep</code> over and over again.</li>
    <li><em>"Do not teach your grandmother to suck eggs":</em> I don't know what this means, I just thought it was funny.</li>
    </ol>
