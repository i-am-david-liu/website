    <p>Science relies on reason—form a hypothesis, test the hypothesis through experimentation, and validate the results. Or, in more formal branches such as mathematics and logic, we propose claims and attempt to prove them.</p>
    <p>Science is backed by <em>rules</em> and <em>methods of thought</em>. Those who prefer systems may feel comfortable working in this field.</p>
    <p>Art, on the other hand, taps into a faculty we've tried and failed to reduce to components. Art relies on senses, gut feelings, intuitions, aesthetic taste…It's become an <em>art</em> to analyze art; translating the pictorial canvas into powerful, imagetic verses that dazzle and venerate.</p>
    <p>The languages of science and art stand in opposition due to their diverging stances. Scientific research papers account for precision and accuracy—substance matters more than style. Ideas and analyses must be clear and direct. The goal of science is to improve knowledge, not to obfuscate or subvert it.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the language of art doesn't seek to improve knowledge, but rather experience. Art begs the question of "how will the audience feel?" rather than "what will the audience learn?" Art tampers with the imagination, letting the ideas pile up in a formless stack until our eyes catch a glimmer deep within. Meanwhile, science attempts to pre-package transmitted ideas in a logical sequence, because one odd piece may shatter the expectations of such a rational field.</p>
    <p>The stereotype of "scientist vs. artist" is an old one, and it is true, based on personal experience, that those who flock to physics, math, and computer science often have no patience for modern art museums, while those who paint and read literature generally shudder when they see a whiteboard full of oblique symbols. There's nothing wrong with either; it's just a matter of perspective.</p>
    <p>But I think fabricating a wall between science and art neglects the fact both fields can live in yin-yang harmony. What of architecture, which relies on engineering and composition? Or figure drawing, which benefits from a greater-than-average understanding of human anatomy? What about the hard science fiction genre? Or computer-aided design? Or building physics-heavy video games? These all tap from science and art, and the result is often more beautiful than either field in separate.</p>
