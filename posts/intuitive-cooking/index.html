    <hr>
    <p>Whenever I cook, I prefer to measure everything by eye. Here are the reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'm lazy and want to minimize the number of things I have to wash later.</li>
      <li>To reinforce a sense of volume independent from measuring spoons and cups. If I gained the ability to suss out quarters, halves, and wholes, all by eye, my prep would fly a lot quicker and I'd have less to clean (refer to reason 1). Note that although I say "volume", I actually mean "quantity", which takes into account both liquids and solids.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Another reason for spoon/cup independence is the ability to cook in unequipped kitchens. Once, I found myself in a kitchen that <em>only had serrated knives</em>, and it was a profoundly threatening experience. As a result, my <a href="https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Inland_Empire">inland empire</a> told me there's a kitchen out there that has never seen the glint of a Pyrex measuring cup, and I stand to be prepared for it. </p>
    <p>There are two exceptions to this system (or really, the opposite of one).</p>
    <p>The first is if I've never made the dish before. If I had no conception of how a dish was supposed to taste, sticking to the recipe would be my best bet for a good example. Then, after establishing a baseline, I can revert back to no-measurement chaos.</p>
    <p>The second exception is if I'm baking something, particularly things of the bread genus. I don't trust my visual intuition to measure out a 7:10 water to flour mixture, let alone the salt and yeast. In fact, I've never seen or heard of someone who could put together a baked good by sight. It's just too precise.</p>
    <p>Besides baking, we're left with dishes like pasta, stir-fry, soups, marinades; as popular weekly meals, I think they're best arranged through guesstimation and raw "feel". I certainly don't have the energy or diligence to measure a brown sauce down to the quarter-teaspoon. I just dump whatever I need into a bowl, taste, and compensate accordingly.</p>
    <p>I'll also argue that these dishes benefit from imprecise quantities, as it encourages the cook to experiment. Personally, I try to make things differently every time, usually improving on some aspect I failed on the previous iteration. And yes, recipes are measured out for a reason, but this flows naturally into my next thought: <em>taste and flavor are ridiculously subjective.</em></p>
    <p>Back in the spring of 2022, I made <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-panna-cotta-vanilla-bean-recipe">panna cotta</a> topped with roasted berries for a small potluck. Here were some of the verdicts, paraphrasing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>"The panna cotta had too much of a 'dairy flavor', but the roasted berries were tart enough to improve it overall."</em></li>
      <li><em>"The panna cotta was just right, but the berries were too sour to enjoy."</em></li>
      <li><em>"Everything was perfect."</em></li>
      <li><em>"I didn't like it."</em></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Wow. My dessert drew responses that covered all possible scenarios. It's simultaneously elegant and hair-pulling.</p>
    <p>I did end up following the recipe, as it was my first time making panna cotta. Dangerous move for a potluck, I know, but it ended up being a hit. Point being, a recipe is just <em>one</em> interpretation of a dish; that interpretation may not be your favorite, but it's a good starting point (which is why I measure things out on the first run).</p>
    <p>This is why we have a thousand different methods for mac and cheese. This also explains why popular foods (burgers, fries, soda) often take advantage of the most pleasurable tastes and flavors, exploiting salt, umami, and sweetness. Bigger targets are easier to hit.</p>
    <p>Note: I do the whole no-measure thing because I'm comfortable with cooking. If you're just starting out or have no interest in cooking whatsoever, you should probably stick to the measurements. I'm at the point where I feel burdened by measuring spoons. You know, the ones where each spoon is rounded in such a way that makes sink water sploosh out of it like a fountain, getting stains all over your pants and making you look like you had a bit of a wee.</p>
    <p>I think it'll be easier for me in the long run if I started training myself to perceive volumes directly, without the use of an aid. There was a time back in college where I learned how to gauge two and a half cups of water with one flush of the faucet; no extra pouring or filling afterwards. I felt like God. The trick relied on the fact that flow was constant when the handle was turned to the max; by removing flow as a variable, I was left with time. Through trial and error, I reasoned that the faucet at maximum flow produced two and a half cups of water in just over seven seconds.</p>
    <p>And that's how I optimized prepping rice for my rice cooker.</p>
    <p>As a closer, here are some problems that arise when I don't measure what I cook:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>It's hard to transmit recipes when you don't know the exact quantities. There's little benefit in saying "a small spoon of baking soda" or "three twirls of olive oil", particularly for someone who hasn't conceived of the recipe yet. This is my biggest problem, because I might have stumbled upon a <em>killer</em> tomato sauce recipe, and I want to hone it further.</li>
    <li>It's hard to know when you mess up. This is an uncomfortable truth, and it makes me doubt the whole "no-measure" thing as a viable strategy. If I eyeball brown sauce for a stir fry and it comes out too salty, does that mean I put in too much soy sauce? Or was it because of the oyster sauce? I can't derive a conclusion based on two unknowns.</li>
    <li>You get a teeny-tiny bit annoyed when people use measuring vessels for the most trivial tasks. Vocalizing this irritation is borderline gatekeeping, so I make sure never to judge or hawk people over this, especially if they're beginners. But I did feel my blood pressure rise when I observed my roommates filling up half a tablespoon of sesame oil up to the brim, and tossing it in the sink right after. Just pour the oil from the bottle! It's only half a tablespoon!</li>
    </ul>
