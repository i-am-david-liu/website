    <hr>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unitasker">Unitaskers</a></strong> are things made for one specific purpose that fail at everything else. This is a popular term used in cooking, particularly when labelling strange utensils buried in the depths of your kitchen cabinet.</p>
    <p>Examples of kitchen unitaskers include, in my opinion: egg timers, grapefruit knives, garlic presses, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/830105192078770226/1063593344434962572/IMG_3850.jpg">whatever the hell this is</a>, and my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WGJ6WKY?tag=seriouseats-onsite-prod-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=5123611%7Cn14c5e8e9769244da92926fbc71f0b27322%7CB07WGJ6WKY">egg boilers</a>.</p>
    <p>Not all unitaskers are useless. For example, pizza cutters are objectively the best tools for slicing pies, while salad spinners can rinse off leafy greens faster than strainers.</p>
    <p>It also depends on how often you'll be using them. If you need to pit 200 cherries per day, maybe invest in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_pitter">cherry pitter</a>. Otherwise, you probably don't need one.</p>
    <p><em>Q: Can't I just buy a cherry pitter and keep it in my cupboard? What is there to lose?</em></p>
    <p>A: Sure. You can populate your kitchen with anything you wish. But unitaskers are just a segue to my argument: we ought to prioritize tools that can do many things, rather than tools that specialize.</p>
    <p>This statement might sound obvious to you. A tool that can perform seven tasks effectively is generally better than a tool that can perform one task very well (assuming the tasks are drawn from the same pool). You want to find a <em>minimum covering</em> for your most common functions. The uncommon ones, like shucking oysters or pasta-rolling, can be unitasked.</p>
    <p>This leads to a question: for some category of tasks, what is the minimum set of tools that maximize performance?</p>
    <p>We don't have to focus on kitchens. What is the minimally viable set of tools for woodworking? For strength training? For setting up a home server?</p>
    <p>Can expertise be represented as the "scaling up" of a set of tools, such that they maximally cover a category of tasks? (Compare the amateur painter who has two brushes large and small, and the artisan who has a brush for every stroke.)</p>
