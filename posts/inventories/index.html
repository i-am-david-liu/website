    <p>when i graduated college and moved back home, i took several hours cleaning out my room, removing as many petty trinkets and items as i could. they "sparked no joy," as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo">Marie Kondo</a> would've put it. i've never watched her shows, but i respect her way of thinking, and her way of thinking got me thinking about my way of thinking, and i figured my thoughts were highly coupled with the environment, so i cleared everything out.</p>
    <p>for me, clean rooms beget clear thoughts, and i find it best to live with as little material as possible. i cannot keep track of so many items at once. trashing things is a compulsion. i put things in the sink when i haven't finished using them yet. i close browser tabs before knowing what they contain. i'm the kind of person who keeps zero unread emails, which i found to be a terrifying trait for (normal) people. i keep a mental inventory of everything i own, their places, their uses, their history. i don't do it compulsively; it's automatic, or at least it feels that way. (i worded this as if i had a special skill, but i'm pretty sure the majority of us do the same thing.)</p>
    <p>knowing where all my belongings are makes them easy to move, but keeping track of everything makes me averse to collecting more objects. when i encounter a candidate object, i simulate a little interview, "what is your purpose? what value will you bring? is there anything you can provide that the existing objects cannot?" if they pass the interview (recently, it was a set of colored wooden chopsticks and a wooden spoon), i adopt them into my possession. if they fail the interview, they are not welcome.</p>
    <p>sometimes i do inventory checks to see if any of my possessions have depreciated in value. in less robotic terms, i "clean house", trashing things i believe i'll never use again.</p>
    <p>yet when i trash, the miniature Marie Kondo living inside my brain cries, "no trashing! <em>find what you want to keep.</em>"</p>
    <p>find what you want to keep. to be honest, i don't understand the difference between noticing what you should keep vs. noticing what you should trash. there's an old wired mouse sitting on my shelf, and it brings me negative joy just thinking about it, stupid mouse, i'm going to trash you. yet trashing is the same as not keeping, so what do you mean, Kondo, what do you mean?</p>
    <p>maybe i'm thinking about it too logically. trashing and keeping are inverses, that is true, and one might be able to do some semantic gymnastics to claim it is not, but perhaps we're dealing with the <em>mindsets</em> behind trashing and keeping instead of their denotations. perhaps a "trashing mindset" is too negative, and relegates the world to measures of utility, where there is a minimum value cutoff for every object. objects that do not meet the cutoff are deemed "worthless", and are cleaved from our lives.</p>
    <p>meanwhile, a "keeping mindset" views all objects as inherently "keepable", but we can only keep the objects that really, really matter to us. so, if i adopt this mindset while i clean house, i should concentrate on sorting the objects i want to keep, rather than sorting the objects i want to trash.</p>
    <p>trashing targets worthlessness, while keeping targets worth. i see. it's kind of analogous to the optimism-pessimism dichotomy, you know, the half cup of water and all.</p>
    <p>if i follow Kondo's advice, i ought to consider my possessions in terms of how much they matter to me instead of how little. although they technically mean the same thing, also note that a cup half-full and a cup half-empty also mean the same thing. where we start our measurements (minimum vs. maximum, none vs. all) really do affect how we perceive our surroundings. and personally, i believe it is more fulfilling to perceive the world in terms of treasure, rather than trash.</p>
