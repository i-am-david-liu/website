    <p>The first rule of the internet is, "don't believe anything on the internet."</p>
    <p>It works most of the time: anyone can make unfounded claims behind a screen, and it takes very little work to treat such claims as truth. I say "most of the time" because the rule is hyperbolic for figurative effect; with enough fact-checking and individual research, it's totally possible for truth to emerge over the internet.</p>
    <p>This doesn't happen often, though. No one's crazy enough to fact-check <em>every single message</em> they come across online; the internet doesn't deserve such meticulous effort. Instead, we tend to ignore the claims that aren't worth our time. This is an <em>okay</em> heuristic, but it may lead to negative feedback loops where "good" beliefs are continuously reinforced regardless of verity (echo chambers).</p>
    <p>To avoid such loops, we have to expend more cognitive work in making sure our beliefs are well-founded. However, we can't expect everyone to approach the internet like a bunch of scientists; it's an unreasonable bar. <em>I want to use the internet for memes and video essays, not reasoning or analysis!</em></p>
    <p>Given the massive content space on the internet, it's impractical to control every tidbit of information that runs across our screen without limiting the amount of content altogether. Because of this, our judgments rely more on intuition rather than evidence; what <em>feels</em> right increases our belief in that respect, and what <em>feels</em> wrong decreases it in kind.</p>
    <p>The way in which we empirically regard or disregard online claims makes me a firm believer in <em>dangerous information</em>. Yes, ideas can be dangerous. Ideas can spread and infect. It's a bit of a new concept, ideas as viruses, but I think it's a concept worth investigating.</p>
    <p>Unlike viruses, which require a physical medium for transmission (air, water, surfaces), ideas only need conscious transmitters and receivers. A neat thing about the internet is it removes physical barriers for idea transmission, but it also makes transmission <em>really, really fast</em>. The internet is to misinformation as a flooded village is to cholera. Unless we're painstakingly diligent, we'll fall to infection at some point.</p>
    <p>And because it takes way too much work to double-check everything we see online, it becomes extremely convenient for hostile agents to exploit such rapid transmission. Hostile agents can, for instance, leak initial claims that <em>appear</em> to be true and are nontrivial to disprove:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"We might experience a melon shortage soon"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>gradually escalating such claims once the original beliefs have been hardened:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Melons will jump in price by end of month, buy them ASAP"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and finally reaching some target level of hostility when the roots grow deep enough:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Recent govt. bill responsible for fruit shortage, melon-lovers devastated"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this hypothetical world, let us assume melon-lovers occupy a large proportion of the population. The hostile agents responsible for promoting Melon-gate may have just alienated a very large voter base through a strategic deployment of disinformation. Also notice how the cause-and-effect is cyclical: by hyping up the demand for melons, the supply artificially decreases, so of course there will be a shortage.</p>
    <p>Weird thought experiments aside, I'm sure most of us are familiar with real-world examples of false information (see: stolen elections, COVID-19). The reason why these realms of thought even exist can be tied back to a previous point: ideas are viruses. Ideas can spread and infect.</p>
    <p>But note that the concept of viral ideas ought to be disentangled from "good and evil"; just because we're comparing an idea to a virus does not mean the idea will definitively produce harm. A viral idea is simply one that spreads quickly and is known by many. An important subset of viral ideas, however, is misinformation and disinformationâ€”incorrect beliefs that can lead us deeper into the jungle.</p>
<p>As the rate of content creation accelerates, whether through AI or more convenient tools, I suspect similar rates of development in "content safety", or the ideological version of handwashing. School curricula will teach basic methods for identifying false claims and performing independent research; meanwhile, states will adopt stricter measures for online content as the security of physical borders fall due to digitization. A content-driven future may seem overwhelming, but I do believe it's inevitable.</p>
    <p>On a brighter note, I'm curious about the neologisms.</p>
