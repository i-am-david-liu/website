    <p>Consider the age-old question: "Where should we eat?"</p>
    <p>If it were up to me, I'd choose the first place that satisfies the following three conditions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>It is not a chain.</li>
    <li>It is not too expensive (two dollars signs or less on Yelp).</li>
    <li>I have a desire to eat their food (the obvious, but necessary condition).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once I find a suitable restaurant, I stop looking for more. Close app; start route.</p>
    <p><em>Q: But you're disqualifying all the potential restaurants that might be better than the one you chose!</em></p>
    <p>A: Exactly. I'm not looking for the <em>best</em> restaurant; I'm looking for one that <em>satisfies</em> my conditions (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">satisficing</a>). Accumulating options in search of the "right choice" just leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision fatigue</a>, making it harder on yourself and whoever else is involved.</p>
    <p>I learned about this a little too late. I used to scroll endlessly through the content labyrinth, gathering as much data as I could about what movies were on which streaming service. After collecting, I'd end up with a mental list so massive and intractable that I start losing hope in watching something at all. I'd have wasted half an hour debating the possible futures in which I decided on a movie, rather than settling on the first future that satisfied my threshold of enjoyment.</p>
    <p>I follow my own advice. Now, I snap up the first flick that catches my eye, fast enough before any maladaptive patterns set in. What is there to lose? If I watch a bad movie today (recently, it was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1488606/">Triple Frontier (2019)</a>), I can always try again later.</p>
    <p>Whenever I start thinking about the <em>possibility</em> of more satisfaction, even when I'm already satisfied, I recognize it as a siren song and dismiss it.</p>
    <p>Plus, I find that I tend to erroneously regard ratings as strict measures (i.e. "you <em>will</em> enjoy this movie, because it has an 8.5 on IMDb") rather than expected values (i.e. "this movie has an 8.5 on IMDb, so there is a strong chance you will enjoy it"). By internalizing ratings as a probabilistic measure, I place less emphasis on critical reception and more on how I'd personally react to the content.</p>
    <h3 id="pointofclarification">Point of clarification</h3>
    <p>The first-choice method works best in situations that do not value careful, logical thinking. Please do not pick the first car or job offer available. Cars and job offers have the potential to affect your life in much greater ways than movies or restaurants.</p>
