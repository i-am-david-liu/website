    <p>ChatGPT is a conversational chatbot. Because of this, I prefer using it for advice over search engines.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT gives a clear, concise summary of your question. No more scrolling through useless stock photos or extraneous introductory paragraphs. When I ask DuckDuckGo, "What happens to baking powder when it expires?", the first link leads to <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/514547-what-happens-if-you-use-expired-baking-powder/">this site</a>. Check it out for yourself; the answer is hidden at the bottom of the page.</p>
    <p>Okay, maybe that was just bad luck. Let's check out <a href="https://www.fitibility.com/does-baking-powder-go-bad/">the second link</a>. There's a bit more information here, like baking powder's shelf life and ways to store it, but I don't care about those. I want to know what happens to expired baking powder.</p>
    <p>I asked the same question to ChatGPT, and here's what it said:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When baking powder expires, it may lose its potency and effectiveness as a leavening agent. This means that it may not be able to properly rise the dough or batter in your recipe.</p>
      <p>It's chemical composition is composed of baking soda, cream of tartar and a moisture-absorbing agent, over time, the moisture-absorbing agent will absorb the moisture from the air, making the baking powder lose its ability to react with the liquids in the recipe and produce the carbon dioxide that makes the dough rise.</p>
      <p>It's best to discard expired baking powder and replace it with a fresh container to ensure that your baked goods turn out properly.</p>
      <p>You can test the freshness of baking powder by mixing a small amount with hot water, if it fizzes, it's still good.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This, to me, was a perfect answer. It was concise enough to scan, and the related knowledge (chemical composition, testing freshness) was dispersed evenly such that any follow-up questions were also resolved. If I had relied on a search engine, I would've had to spend time sifting through a mess of facts.</p>
    <p><strong>My prediction:</strong> As chatbots get smarter and faster, they may end up replacing search engines. Chatbots have the unique ability to condense and summarize information over large swaths of knowledge; meanwhile, search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo are simply algorithms that rank human-generated content, many of which have been engineered to fight for the first page rather than to answer our queries.</p>
    <p>In general, chatbots will be optimized for Q&amp;A type queries, like learning what capacitors do or figuring out how to unclog a sink, while search engines will primarily be used for more "anthropic" questions such as finding the nearest pizzeria or looking for a specific website.</p>
    <p>However, I don't expect chatbots to replace expert-level advice in the near future, especially when such information is novel and has only been elaborated in research papers and obscure blogs. Chatbots will also most likely be unable to produce knowledge on recent events, as the language model it was trained on will probably be time-frozen. Nonetheless, I still believe they have massive potential as a generalized problem-solving tool.</p>
