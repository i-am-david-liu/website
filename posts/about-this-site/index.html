    <hr>
    <p>It's been five months since I posted something here. Not because I'm busy, but because I'm apprehensive towards publicizing my thoughts. I held onto this belief for a while, even though the impetus for <a href="https://dliu.xyz">dliu.xyz</a> was to publicize my thoughts.</p>
    <p>After reading the cream of the cream of the cream of the crop on places like <a href="https://gwern.net">gwern.net</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, I tend to forget how disorganized, disjointed, and down-to-earth most blogs were on the Internet. And there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
    <p>So for the following month—January 2023—I've decided to challenge myself. I will write one blog post every day. Topics generated straight off the dome. No backtracking, no self-guessing, no puffed-chest refinement that maximize my chances for a job (please hire me). I will write for the sake of writing.</p>
    <p>There's lots of things I want to write about. Arch Linux has been on my mind for a while, as I've developed this love-hate relationship with a system that breaks just to remind me how complex and monolithic modern computers are.</p>
    <p>Then we have ancient thoughts on things like food, consumerism, art, the knowledge divergence between technology and their users…</p>
    <p>I ought to keep a list somewhere. My mind palace looks less like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Família</a> and more like a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3OOtClr.png">Minecraft starter house</a>.</p>
    <p>I'll see you in January.</p>
