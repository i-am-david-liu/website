    <p>After reading Joan Didion's <em><a href=https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Joan-Didion-On-Keeping-a-Notebook.pdf>"On Keeping a Notebook"</a></em> and <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/learn-the-art-of-journaling-and-archive-your-life">this article</a>, I realized I never once asked myself <em>why</em> I journal.</p>
    <p>I've been journaling for almost a month now (since December 22, 2022), which is not long at all. In fact, most veteran journal-keepers might categorize me as "just starting out". If they do, I agree. The way I write and organize my thoughts change every week or so, and I expect this to continue for many months.</p>
    <p>This is what I write in:</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/830105192078770226/1064941126500491275/IMG_3853.jpg" alt="journal" /></p>
    <p>It's a dotted Moleskin journal, soft black cover. I don't like lines or grids because they're too restricting and busy on the eyes. Blank journals are fineâ€”I would've opted for one if the dotted versions weren't available.</p>
    <p>I like dotted notebooks because they're flexible. You can see them as grids and lines, and they're minimal enough to ignore when you need to sketch freeform ideas. As of now, I can't think of anything better.</p>
    <p>My journal is mostly tasklists, extended thoughts on events, dialogues on personal problems, plus little notes and reminders. I don't do the whole "what happened today" thing; I think it's more rewarding to talk about matters I care about rather than what I ate for breakfast.</p>
    <p>After reflecting for a bit, I conclude that I primarily journal to <em>keep my thoughts in order</em>. It's hard to organize everything in your head, with all those issues, desires, predictions, and uncomfortable truths clacking around like billiard balls.</p>
    <p>A journal is an extension of your thought-machine, and the best thing about it is your <em>ideas don't change</em> when archived. They stay on the page, and you can refer to it a day later, a month later, a decade. Human memory is prone to distortion, but the written word is not. A belief can be altered in unconscious ways, but penned language (generally) requires a conscious effort to destroy.</p>
    <p>Journals are also useful to make sure important ideas stick with you through time. They're like static memory.</p>
    <p>Before I bought a journal, one of my main concerns was access. As a tail-end millennial (or an early zoomer), I grew up with cloud sync and the utilitarian joy of cross-compatibility. I worried that physical journals were too inconvenient compared to, say, a Google Doc or whatever note-taking app was making the rounds that year.</p>
    <p>I resolved this pretty quick by realizing one thing: journals are, to an extent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera">ephemera</a>. In other words, they're not meant to be things to keep for the future; journals are things to keep for the <em>present</em>. As I said before, journals can be conceived as extensions of our minds, simple devices that help us organize our thoughts in the here and now. They're meant to be private, and they're often boring and meaningless to anyone other than the author. As Didion wrote,</p>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
      <p>"Your notebook will never help me, nor mine you."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To fully harness the power of journaling, we need to relinquish the idea of journals as keepsakes. If one chars in a fire, we get another. The worst thing we can lose is an outline of a past identity and maybe a smattering of insights. Journals are arbitrators for our misaligned minds, and best of all, you can do whatever you want with them.</p>
