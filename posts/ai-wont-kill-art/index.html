    <p>It won't even be close.</p>
    <p>I'm confident our current trajectory of AI progress will result in AI products that surpass the human limit, whether it be paintings, graphics, essays, stock photos, background music…</p>
    <p>But whether or not people, particularly those who see value in art, will consciously <em>choose</em> an AI-generated picture over one that's human-made depends on how we view artistic intention.</p>
    <p>Here's an analogy: why do people buy crafts when mass-manufacturing can achieve the same outcome? If everyone truly operated out of convenience, then there would be no practical reason to buy a $6 bar of homemade soap at the farmer's market rather than a 50 cent bar of Dove soap at Target (not realistic; factory soap is so cheap that they're usually sold in bulk).</p>
    <p>Instead, many of us (including myself) care about the <em>source</em> of such objects. This is why "Made in the U.S." has become a marketing tag, grouped in with other PR mantras like "ethically sourced" and "organic" and "artisan". Human-made objects carry more value than factory-made objects, regardless of quality. Humans prefer human things.</p>
    <p>Then, it makes sense to say that human-made art carries more value than AI-generated art. But of course, it depends on perspective. Practical minds generally care more about outcomes rather than the processes behind them. A mixed collection of human-made art and AI-generated art will simply be a collection; art is art, and nothing more. If an AI manages to create paintings (subjectively) more beautiful than any human in history, then the products of such an AI will have the highest (subjective) value.</p>
    <p>On the other end, aesthetic minds generally consider art from a broader scope, from inception to process to product. The <em>way</em> the art was produced matters as much as the final judgment. In fact, the final judgment may depend on extraneous qualities such as the author's intent, their creative process, symbols and meanings, and even the social, historical, and environmental contexts of the piece.</p>
    <p>When taking those qualities into account, it is hard to justify whether or not an AI—a pure machine—can satisfy them. How do we embed <em>intent</em> in a learning model? Will a machine truly understand symbols and motifs? Can an AI generalize beyond the material it was fed and develop its own unique style?</p>
    <p>There is also very little to be said of the context surrounding an AI during its "creative process"; typically, such a creative process is an algorithm. There is no intuition or <a href="/posts/eurekas/">eureka</a> involved in running an algorithm—only rules to abide by. How much value are we willing to place on an "artist" who follows an explicit formula for creativity? Can creativity even be defined by formulas and rules? I wonder if an AI, irrespective of its productivity or quality, should even be considered "creative", as the term implies the strictly human ability to imagine and express.</p>
    <p>Sure, AI art generators may swallow a big chunk of the art industry, but the silver lining is it will make human art more valuable than ever. As the markets become flooded with synthetic, superficial content (as if it weren't already), content which retained some semblance of ingenuity or innovation will be treasured. We can model this transition as we did with the soap bar analogy: today, "craft soaps" are worth more than factory soaps, despite the fact "craft soaps" were just known as "soap" before the industrial revolution.</p>
    <p>AI art at its best is human invention at its worst. I'm not afraid of AI killing art, because art will always remain an anthropic design. It is only when machines begin to think as we do, grasping emotions and human intuition through code, would I begin to truly worry.</p>
