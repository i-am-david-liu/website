    <p>I'm interested in lucid dreaming, <a href="/posts/my-first-lucid-dream">as stated in my previous post</a>.</p>
    <p>One of the key ideas in lucid dreaming is <em>awareness</em>. Knowing how to distinguish between the real world and the dream world requires focus and a bit of mental discipline. Yet if one isn't aware of experiences in their waking life, why would they expect to be aware of their interior worlds as well?</p>
    <p>The passage from reality to dreamland takes training, too. One has to suppress any notion of excitement or anticipation and let their body fall asleep as naturally as possible, while simultaneously maintaining a grip on lucidity. This sounds straightforward in concept: keep your mind active while the sleep takes over. However, straightforward concepts do not imply that they're convenient to perform. Riding a unicycle takes pedaling and balance, but it doesn't mean you can hop on and join a circus before the sun sets.</p>
    <p>Deliberately prompting a lucid dream requires one to be in control of their thoughts. If "clearing your head" makes you bored or anxious, inducing a lucid dream might as well provoke the same.</p>
    <p>When one exerts powerful awareness (or mindfulness) in their daily life, such as noticing the beat of their breath or the color of a room light, they have a better chance at facilitating lucid dreams. They're more accustomed to notice signs that they're currently in a dream, and particularly strong individuals can even perform maintenance when the dream starts to fragment.</p>
    <p>These "powers" are beyond me, a lowly neophyte who can't even remember their dreams 80% of the time. But I have intuitions on how to acquire them in the future.</p>
    <h3 id="thehereandnow">The here and now</h3>
    <p>There are many paths to train awareness. While researching, I noticed a pattern that orbited around two central ideas: attention and habit.</p>
    <p><strong>Attention</strong>, or focus, is the ability to maintain an idea or sensation without interruption. I think about attention a lot, because I believe it's a fundamental skill that underlies any activity. A good attention span results in more consistent projects and behaviors, while a bad span creates a heaping pile of unfinished ideas. (<em>Note</em>: I acknowledge that attention is <em>not</em> a quality that can be magically trained by everyone, especially in the context of attention disorders. However, for the sake of this post, I will be evaluating attention from my own experiences.)</p>
    <p>During lucid dreaming, attention is highly coupled with awareness, as one has to <em>maintain</em> their awareness in order to seamlessly transition from reality to dreamland. If it is difficult to maintain one's maintenance, the probability of a successful, deliberate lucid dream trickles down to zero.</p>
    <p>In comparison, <strong>habit</strong> is a kind of meta-process that sculpts your behavior to approach an ideal. For example, people who want gains might build exercise routines or healthy eating habits in order to approach a desired fitness level. As kids, we formed brushing habits to keep our teeth clean. And if we want to approach an ideal of "<em>being a successful lucid dreamer</em>", we need habits that remind us to be aware.</p>
    <p>A popular habit for identifying dream states is <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Reality_Checks/Hands">counting your fingers</a>. By building this habit in the real world, you might end up performing it in the dream world. The "trick" is that visual perception in the dream world is often irrational; by identifying the unexpected (you somehow counted six fingers), you realize the environment isn't real, and the dream becomes lucid.</p>
    <p>There are other tricks, like touching your palms or breathing while holding your nose. I won't be talking about the differences between them; frankly, I don't think the differences matter. The most important point is to continually remind ourselves that <em>we are currently real</em>, and if that statement is false, then <em>we are currently dreaming</em>.</p>
    <p>In summary, attention allows you to <em>maintain</em> awareness, while habit <em>reminds</em> you to be aware. Although these two qualities can be independently useful, it's always better to have both.</p>
    <p>Currently, I believe I don't have the capacity to lucid dream, because <em>I am not aware</em>. Sure, sometimes I might stop to look up at a tree, and I habitually execute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage collection</a> on my thoughts to identify maladaptive patterns. Maintaining long stretches of awareness, however, is a beast I've yet to conquer.</p>
    <p>On reflection, this sounds more like an attention problem, but I wonder if there are any habits that might help me with long-term focus.</p>
    <h3 id="apersonalexperience">A personal experience</h3>
    <p>Yesterday night, while falling asleep, I tried anchoring my focus to the electric hum of my desktop. Sensory anchors prevent your brain from going to sleep completely, which helps with the transition from reality to dreams (the scientific term is <em>hypnagogia</em>).</p>
    <p>I discovered anchoring was <em>stupid hard</em>. For one, I had a song stuck in my head during that time, and I had no idea how to get rid of it. My mind also kept wandering from place to place, and every once in a while I'd think of something funny and audibly chuckle.</p>
    <p>Over a period of half an hour or so, I task-switched between focusing on the hum, getting rid of the earworm, and retracing my wandering thoughts. It was a straining experience, and I ended up making myself less tired than I started. In a sense, I had overcompensated the "awareness meter" of lucid dreaming; I wanted my brain to be about 10% aware, but I had kept it running at 80%.</p>
    <p>This morning, I reflected on what happened and realized my attention span was still mediocre at best, even after spending two years attempting to hone it into a better shape. I have trouble focusing on one thing at a time, not because I'm <a href="/posts/chasing-the-dragon">chasing a better stimulus</a>, but because I lack the ability to pare away my competing thoughts.</p>
    <p>One possible "fix" is to try meditating. Meditation can be defined as "a singular focus on an idea", but any definition more complex than the one I gave is subject to competition.</p>
    <p>And when I talk about meditating, don't accept the mental image of half-naked yogis sitting criss-cross on a bamboo mat. Meditation, to me, is as simple as lying on a couch listening to your breath. At a high-level, meditation trains your mind to <em>reject its own inclinations</em>. In other words, you can command your brain to focus on whatever you want, with little resistance.</p>
    <p>I think of meditation as a rock-skip to achieving total mental control, a cognitive state where the individual sees their thoughts from a bird's eye view and can correct any beliefs or schemas that seem out of line. When your mind starts to wander or get caught in negative feedback loops, you're able to say, "don't do that," and your mind will agree.</p>
    <p>Right now, this is an ideal I want to chase.</p>
