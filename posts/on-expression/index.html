    <p>The ideas in the post will follow a familiar structure: I will describe two extreme ends of a qualitative spectrum and propose how the "middle point" is ideal. Uninspiring—I know. But thinking through the concepts definitely helped change my behavior for the better, as I had previously found myself tilted towards one of the extremes. The tiny probability that it may help others, too, is enough to substantiate its being.</p>
    <p>This post will talk about <em>expression</em>, or the way we communicate and explain our thoughts.</p>
    <h3 id="speakingvsthinking">Speaking vs. thinking</h3>
    <p>Expression is fundamental to interaction. Determining <em>what</em> to express may influence the outcome of an interview or a business proposal. Expression, used well, can mediate conflicts, distill hard ideas, and steer arguments towards constructive states. I cannot think of any downsides to being a good expressor, other than the fact some may find the quality socially intimidating (good expression is often dual to being a good arguer).</p>
    <p>I also want to clarify that the definition of <em>expression</em> in context of this post does not take into account social anxiety or physical barriers to speech (in regards to social anxiety, see <em>Note 1</em> below). Here, expression is <em>how certain we are in transmitting our ideas to the world</em>. Low expression means low certainty: ideas need to be rigorously evaluated before sending them off into the environment. On the other hand, high expression implies high certainty: what we think is what we display, unfiltered.</p>
    <p>We can model the "spectrum of expression" as two opposing ends. One end is <em>thinking</em>, while the other end is <em>speaking</em>.</p>
    <p>The extreme end for <em>thinking</em> portrays individuals who almost never share their thoughts. This does not imply they have nothing to say; often, it is the opposite. Individuals who prioritize getting their thoughts in order spend so much cognitive effort in doing so they routinely lose the opportunity to share at all. They may fall into rationalization pits with signs labelled "useless thought" or "unclear idea", and in order to reduce risk/error, they may find it more practical to clam up.</p>
    <p>Individuals with low expression have a tough time pointing out other people's mistakes and taking control of situations. They tend to triple-guess themselves and consider irrational possibilities (e.g. "what if I offend them?" or "what if they laugh?"). Mentally, they believe that the world-state in which they don't share their thoughts will have less risk than the world-state in which they do. The risk, for low expressors, is <em>being wrong</em>.</p>
    <p>On the other end, we have <em>speaking</em>. Individuals skewed towards this quality can be judged (often in haste) as overconfident, presumptuous, and impulsive. The interface between what they're thinking vs. what they choose to say tends to lack any social filters whatsoever.</p>
    <p>In contrast to low expressors, high expressors generally don't give a shit about being wrong. To them, being wrong carries very little risk; they can always acknowledge the mistake and get on with it. <a href="/posts/theres-something-about-proverbs/">After all, isn't failure a learning experience?</a> However, a danger to speaking your mind all the time is it increases the probability of saying something truly, terribly, <em>horribly</em> wrong, something that may lead to social backlash and alienation. I imagine we're all familiar with this, particularly in context of certain social media platforms.</p>
    <h3 id="whatthismeans">What this means</h3>
    <p>Low expressors believe in accuracy. The ideas they share ought to be correct, coherent, and describe itself in the most efficient way possible. They spend more time lining up the shot, straightening the darts, and readjusting their form. This leads to less throws over time and, in consequence, less opportunities to score. (Yes, I know this is not how dart games work, but I couldn't find a better metaphor.)</p>
    <p>High expressors believe in shotgunning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgunning">but not the alcoholic type</a>. High expressors toss a bunch of darts with low accuracy under the expectation that <em>at least some</em> of them will land. It's often quicker than calculating the trigonometric angles for a perfect shot, but every once in a while, a dart might richochet off the edge of the board and embed itself in a bystander's foot, which is typically considered, well, not good.</p>
    <p>So, low expression is an unproductive fear of being wrong (not taking enough shots), while high expression is an unproductive <em>fearlessness</em> of being wrong (taking too many shots).</p>
    <p>The natural solution would be to just take the best of both worlds, as with the majority of human qualities. If an individual has low confidence, then they ought to gain more, but not to the extent that they become arrogant. Similarly, if an individual has low expression, then they ought to train themselves to curb their overanalysis and accept the fact that some of their shots will, on the basis of independent sampling, be incorrect.</p>
    <p>And if an individual speaks their mind too often, they ought to stop and think about the consequences: will my angry friend get less angry if I tell them to "suck it up?" In many cases, no, they will not.</p>
    <h3 id="whatthismeanstome">What this means (to me)</h3>
    <p>Personally, I used to be a high expressor—I would say what <em>I</em> felt was right without taking other perspectives into account. Obviously, this was a deficient trait, and so I quickly learned from my mistakes.</p>
    <p>However, I ended up overcompensating and became a lower-than-usual expressor. I stopped asking questions in class, because my thought process would take longer than the length of opportunity for asking them. I was considering way too many angles and possibilities, most of which could've been resolved if I had asked the original thought in the first place. For example, if I was confused on a particular variable in an equation during a lecture, I would go back into my notes to see if I had written it down. By the time I finished checking, the professor would be talking about something completely different—I had missed my window.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, an ideal expressor would've asked what the variable meant, then and there.</p>
    <p>My goal now is to be a little more assertive in my thoughts. A good way to train this quality is to <a href="/posts/about-this-site/">do what I've been doing for almost a month</a>: putting my thoughts on the internet. I can say for sure that some of my ideas might be considered wrong or completely incoherent, which does keep me up at night sometimes, but I let it go. I realized that if I spent my entire life avoiding mistakes, I'd be forcing myself on an incredibly narrow trajectory with zero room for improvement.</p>
    <p>Being right all the time decreases our tolerance for being wrong. And I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> generalizes the central idea of this post pretty well:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"A person’s success in life is determined by having a high minimum, not a high maximum. If you can do something really well but there are other things at which you’re failing, the latter will hold you back. But if almost everything you do is up there, then you’ve got a good life. And so I try to learn how to get through things that others find unpleasant." [1]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In other words, we should turn our weaknesses into strengths. The previous sentence comes off very corporate and faux-inspirational, but I honestly think it's more practical in comparison to honing one single skill while neglecting everything else. As the saying goes,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than master of one…"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

    <li>Social anxiety <em>may</em> point to low expression, but we tend to forget there are other methods of communication besides verbal speech. Those who aren't confident in their physical image may be rather garrulous over the internet, spilling their thoughts like whitewater. People with truly low expression, at least in my conception, tend to be careful and diligent with what they say both online and offline.</li>
