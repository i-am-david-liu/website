    <p>Blindness isn't the meaty pink you see from closing your eyes. Blindness is <em>nothing</em>. For people who aren't blind, this is difficult, perhaps even impossible, to conceptualize.</p>
    <p>By gaining the ability to see, we lose the ability to imagine what it's like <em>not</em> to see. Very few people (like those who become blind in the future) carry some notion of both.</p>
    <p>The fact that there are ideas we can comprehend, yet fail to model, drives me crazy. Given a thousand years, one might be able to study the entire breadth of human knowledge and maybe even edge the boundaries a bit, but a thousand years will never be enough to understand what it <em>feels</em> to be someone else. Scientific knowledge is acquirable, but qualities are subjective and independent. My red isn't your red. My music isn't your music. It's mental to think about, and it makes me want to go outside holding a banana and yell at strangers, "Describe this to me. Describe it!" But I know I can't do that, especially in a family-dominant suburb.</p>
    <p>I want to taste what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster">supertasters</a> taste. I want to know what infrared looks like. I'm curious in knowing what it feels like to have a pollen allergy. Don't you?</p>
