    <hr>
    <p><em>Preamble:</em> I'm deeply satisfied with my Arch system, and I enjoy the extra work attached. Arch motivates me to care about system maintenance and package management. This post is mostly just me griping about what I <em>want</em> to do on Arch, but can't, because the system doesn't support that sort of thing.</p>
    <p>And no, I don't expect Arch to do everything I want. I fully understand its limitations and accommodate accordingly. But…</p>
    <h3 id="1imageediting">1. Image editing</h3>
    <p>Adobe Photoshop is the best for image editing, hands-down. The UX is clean, I know my way around it, and I can do things like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/vectorize-image.html">vectorize images</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/old-photo-restoration.html">restore old photos</a>, and use my favorite editing tool of all time: <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/tool-techniques/magnetic-lasso-tool.html">the magnetic lasso</a>.</p>
    <p>A quick search on GIMP didn't reveal any of those tasks listed as possibilities.</p>
    <p>Photoshop is also ideal for photo editing (seriously, they have the market cornered). It's something I've been struggling to practice with on Arch. I currently use <a href="https://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a>, which admittedly is more of a database than an editor, but I'll probably take a peek at <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a> next.</p>
    <p>It's worth mentioning that the lack of Linux support for Adobe products in general is well-known. Of course, I can spin up Wine or a Windows VM, or maybe even consider dual-booting, but I don't want to build a bridge just because the other side of the river has prettier flowers.</p>
    <p><em>Q: Isn't that restriction arbitrary and self-imposed?</em></p>
    <p>A: Yes. But I like having all my tools on one system.</p>
    <p><em>Q: So you're trading utility for personal preference?</em></p>
    <p>A: Correct. I can most definitely live without Photoshop. Plus, I get to learn more about the software I use instead, like GIMP and Krita (which are equally fine programs). </p>
    <h3 id="2daws">2. DAWs</h3>
    <p>There's a fancy new app called <a href="https://usebottles.com/">Bottles</a> that lets you run Windows software on Linux. So far, there's support for Ableton Live and FL Studio, which is awesome. I've heard great things about Ableton, and I personally used FL Studio when I couldn't get my hands on Logic Pro (an Apple-walled product).</p>
    <p>To be honest, now that we have Bottles, I don't have any huge issues making music on Arch. But back when Bottles hadn't existed, finding a suitable DAW was <em>painful</em>. Audacity worked well as an audio editor but not as a composer, and I disliked how REAPER and Bitwig Studio felt. I haven't tried Ardour yet, but the <a href="https://ardour.org/">website</a> looks promising. Putting that on my list.</p>
    <h3 id="3gaming">3. Gaming</h3>
    <p>I don't play video games often, but in the off-chance I do, it's a coin-flip with Arch.</p>
    <p>Steam has a compatibility layer called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561?snr=">Proton</a>, but it doesn't work all the time. For example, <em>Terraria</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em> have input bugs where the "move-right" key is continuously pressed, making movement and menu navigation impossible.</p>
    <p>The generic solution would've been to dual-boot Arch and Windows, but I've never felt such a strong urge to play a Linux-incompatible game that I grew motivated to do so. The only possible motivator I would have for dual-booting Windows is if I needed the Windows system itself, like for .NET (I know it's cross-platform and probably works fine on Linux, but my intuition is .NET : Windows :: Swift : MacOS, optimally).</p>
    <p>Recently I haven't been gaming much at all, so I guess it's a problem that solved itself.</p>
    <h3 id="plansforthefutureconcludingmetaphor">Plans for the future + concluding metaphor</h3>
    <p>I want a Mac desktop—a second computer, just to clarify. That way, I can get Logic Pro (my preferred application) and the full suite of Adobe products (Photoshop, Illustrator, and possibly Premiere) to play with. Games aren't a priority, which is why I'm choosing MacOS over Windows.</p>
    <p>Switching operating systems is a lot like moving to a different city. All your desires are minimally satisfied, but the products and services are unfamiliar and you're not quite sure if they're an improvement or plain ersatz. And why do all the streets have weird names?</p>
    <p>Yet, given time, you grow to enjoy those alien comforts. The local bakery might not have your favorite chocolate croissant, but they have a babka that goes <em>hard</em>. And then you realize babkas are tastier than croissants. You wouldn't have figured that out if you stayed behind, surrounded by buildings you can identify by door.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, a context switch is all you need to realize your bubble of championed goods were graded too narrowly, too locally. Because somewhere, out in that complicated, nebulous sea of dimly lit restaurants and intimidating software, there might exist a tool that changes your life for the better. And you'll never know until that sail is set.</p>
    <p>I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
