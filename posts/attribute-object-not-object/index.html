    <p>Non-alcoholic beer.</p>
    <p>Beer, by definition, is alcoholic. When you attribute beer as "non-alcoholic", it loses that definition.</p>
    <p>But does non-alcoholic beer fall in the category of beer? Certainly, if a drink has "beer" in its name, then it must be some <em>variant</em> of beer…right?</p>
    <p>I don't think so.</p>
    <p>As I said before, things that fall under the beer category are <em>defined</em> to be alcoholic. So non-alcoholic beer cannot be in the category of beer, or else we'd have a contradiction (a drink cannot simultaneously be alcoholic and non-alcoholic).</p>
    <p>Non-alcoholic beer is not beer, despite the name. It is a drink that logically deserves its own class.</p>
    <p>Let's look at a typical attribute + object pairing: orange tulip.</p>
    <p>Tulips do not have to be orange to be considered tulips. Therefore, orange tulips fall neatly into the category of tulips. Orange tulips are a <em>subset</em> of tulips.</p>
    <p>But non-alcoholic beer is <em>not</em> a subset of beer. Isn't that weird?</p>
    <p>Here's another example: old news.</p>
    <p>News, by definition, describes "recent information". If it's recent, how can it be old? We can try and massage "old news" to mean "information that <em>used</em> to be recent", but then it wouldn't be news. Contradiction!</p>
    <p><em>Q: So? What's the point? These are just oxymorons.</em></p>
    <p>A: Yes, but they're a stricter class of oxymorons. "Jumbo shrimp" is an oxymoron, but it only works as an oxymoron if we refer to "shrimp" as a "thing that's small", rather than "swimming crustacean". Jumbo shrimp, referring to the animal, conceptually holds, because it literally describes "a type of shrimp that's larger than other types of shrimp".</p>
    <p>Jumbo shrimp, referring to the nonexistent "big thing that's small", is an oxymoron, and a rather forced one at that. We need to warp the meaning of shrimp in order for the contradiction to emerge, and that lacks elegance and poise.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, non-alcoholic beer is an oxymoron in the most explicit sense. We don't need to swap definitions; the definition is already there, and it is actively being contradicted.</p>
    <p><em>Q: Okay, and?</em></p>
    <p>A: I just thought it was cool.</p>
