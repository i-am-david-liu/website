    <hr>
    <p>This is a tough skill to learn.</p>
    <p>Say you're on the third hour of debugging (or writing, painting, composing); you've hit that sweet spot where the rest of the universe has been pared away, and the only things left are your brain and the task at hand. </p>
    <p>What you've entered is a <strong>flow state</strong>: an immersive, hypnotic experience where minutes fly by like seconds. It's the workaholic's nirvana.</p>
    <p>I think <em>flow</em> is one of cognition's natural wonders, and we should all experience it at least once per week, whether deliberately or inadvertently. But a small catch to <em>flow</em> is we may sometimes get so wrapped up in whatever we're doing that we neglect everything else outside of the bubble. Just yesterday I postponed dinner by three hours because I was writing my <a href="https://dliu.xyz/posts/chasing-the-dragon">daily blog post</a>.</p>
    <p>I believe that was a mistake. Writing a blog post shouldn't take priority over feeding myself at a decent time, no matter how many ideas per minute (i/m) I'm generating. It's one of those traits glorified in media, shoehorned into archetypes like the clumsy genius or misunderstood artist. I think we ought to be more careful with those displays.</p>
    <p>It's hard to shift contexts during a flow state for reasons aforementioned. But life is unpredictable, and sometimes little tasks spring up that demand more attention. Like eating dinner, for example.</p>
    <p>And only when there's a clear and present danger to our <em>flow</em> (e.g. your house is on fire) are we most often able to reconnect with reality. Yet a dual model of <em>flow</em>, existing as the Real World and the Flow World, is unoptimal, because the flow-reality converter has a 3,000,000 ms latency and isn't even guaranteed to work unless one of the Worlds become uninhabitable.</p>
    <p>In other words, once you're in, you're <em>in</em>.</p>
    <p>But surely, at some level of self-control and discipline, we ought to be able to wrangle <em>flow</em> into an accessible convenience rather than a bound contract. So here's an idea: the next time we're in a flow state, we should think to ourselves, "We're in a flow state." If you're a lucid dreamer, this strategy might sound familiar.</p>
    <p>By pitching awareness to our <em>flow</em>, we can learn to seamlessly interface it with reality. No more skipping dinners or hearing your roommates wake up before you fall asleep. <em>Flow</em> becomes a tool; a user action. Toggle on, toggle off.</p>
    <p>Of course, it's not as simple as that. And I don't know if the ideal version is even possible. (Maybe there's a mystic analogue tucked deep within the Himalayas?)</p>
    <p>And here's another counter: if we're able to control our <em>flow</em>, wouldn't it cease to become <em>flow</em> in the first place? This curious mental state prides itself on a lack of cognitive control; it's attention on autopilot, essentially. Maybe "controllable flow" deserves its own special term, and I can't help but compare it to <a href="http://www.leighb.com/jhanas.htm">JhƒÅnas</a>, which I understand to be accessible, voluntary states of high concentration.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, "controllable flow" is something I have yet to experiment with. My hope is that awareness of <em>flow</em> won't act as a memetic hazard and destroy said mental state completely.</p>
    <p>I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
