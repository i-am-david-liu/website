    <p>when I was an undergrad at RPI, I spoke to a professor who said they viewed everything from the perspective of energy levels. this checks out, because their specialty is in LEDs.</p>
    <p>a few months later, a friend told me they saw the world in integrals. it's useful when they're summing something up over a period of time, and that thing changes in value:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>i end up picturing a graph and the area under its curve to get a rough idea of the scale of the thing. mainly its just recognizing something like 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + â€¦ grows quadratically. in gaming it gives good intuition for the efficiency of upgrades, for example. it also gives me a quick idea of the computational complexity of code i write.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>never tried guesstimating an integral before, particularly in the real world. keeping that in my back pocket for posterity.</p>
    <p>when asked the question, "how do you see the world?", most (sane) people would answer in context of human nature. like, "I think everyone has hidden goodness", or "I think everyone is motivated by self-interest". these perspectives arguably have more impact on behavior than energy levels or integrals.</p>
    <p>but I think it's interesting to learn what the nerds see. or in a more proper sense, how scientific minds process their experiences. when you trust that everything's quantum, or conceptualize the human mind as an algorithm conducting deep search in a massive action space, or regard all living things as a system whose sole purpose is to convert energy, you gain particular insights generally invisible to competing viewpoints. and it's thrilling to puzzle out what those insights are.</p>
    <p>me? I'm interested in theoretical computer science, so I see everything as a minimax problem (or maximin, depending). we make decisions all the time, and sooner or later I realized there's an entire field dedicated to optimal decision-making.</p>
    <p>here's an example use case: how much food can I spread over three days while minimizing hunger? (college. I no longer have this problem, don't worry about it.)</p>
    <p>and a more cheerful example: how much time should i spend in the shower that maximizes enjoyment but minimizes water waste?</p>
    <p>it's all about moderation, really. always searching for the sweet spot, the golden mean.</p>
