    <p>There's a certain madness in appreciating the sanctity of a nation while acknowledging its freckled past. Two ends of a spectrum, mixing like oil and water. Yet it's incorrect to frame this as a centrist argument; the highs and lows of Americana do reside in opposition, but they occur one after another in mutual embrace. To contextualize an achievement is to dust off the horrors that laid before it. The burden of citizenry, then, is dealing with the morally gray miasma known as "history." </p>
    <p>The Fourth, pockmarked by pyrotechnics and Maillard reactions, is an exercise in our ability to forget. On this profitable day, our forefathers ratified a very important document that nowadays exists as a symbol rather than something to be read. The document is a symbol of freedom, of independence from overseas regal authority, and would catalyze the uniquely American ideal of individualism and rugged ego for generations to come. (The Continental Congress envisioned an empire of red, white, and blue&mdash;a prophecy that did manage to fulfill itself, but inadvertently painted with cop cars and those who drive them.)</p>
    <p>We have a special archetype reserved for America's protagonist. It carries all the perfect traits: self-driven, self-made, zealous possession; our brave pioneers made their first foray into the misty Frontier, driven by the modest notion cleanly expressed as "American exceptionalism." The idea was that America carried some sort of mythic supremacy, that she was destined to chop and colonize her way to the top. And apparently, the best way to do this was to conquer everything that wasn't yet yours.</p>
    <p>Harrowing; perhaps even despicable. But without the push to the West, we would not have most of our states, our oil fields, or the lush, golden prairies that form the backbone of American agriculture. To bring up their questionable roots is functionally irrelevant outside of academia. No one seeks a "solution", as the problem has faded to antiquity. So how do we make up for troubled histories in the face of benefit? Is there really anything we can do but memorialize and wallow? </p>
    <p>This is a tough question I don't yet have the answer to. But one thing I've internalized is that it is completely reasonable to hold multiple perspectives at the same time, especially when studying the means to an end. To harbor respect and contempt for a product or institution is not a form of dissonance, as dissonance implies a division of sides. There are no sides when justifying the fruits of westward migration; the past and present have already occurred. Acknowledgement and reflection, which elevate the past to equal significance, is my way of making peace.</p>
