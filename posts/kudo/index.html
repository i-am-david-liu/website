    <p>in another world, we invented a tiny device that surgically embeds into our brain. the device monitors patterns of neuronal activity and digitizes them, allowing users to control the device with their thoughts.</p>
    <p>through the early stages of the technology, a big company developed an app called KUDO. KUDO is a thought-driven compliment app built using the device's API. KUDO users can communicate with other KUDO users, but they can only identify each other when they're no greater than 20 feet apart. kind of like apple airdrop.</p>
    <p>the goal of KUDO is to <em>compliment</em> other users of KUDO. in order to enforce this, interactions relied on a restricted vocabulary of symbols and terms. such symbols included a "thumbs-up" or a "wave", with terms like "COOL" or "GOOD LUCK" also acting as popular options.</p>
    <p>in order to prevent compliment-gaming, or deliberately orienting one's lifestyle to maximize the amount of compliments one receives, KUDO does not keep track of interactions. messaging in KUDO is fleeting, but on a level more minimal than snapchat. users have no possession over the messages; compliments live for a brief moment, on the order of seconds, and then disappear forever. the only thing that persists is a body-fuzz of gratitude, which is something real compliments have been yielding since the dawn of language.</p>
    <p>when two KUDO users get close enough, one can see the other outlined in a faint glow (the color of the glow can be changed in the appearance menu). the glow indicates that compliments can be sent.</p>
    <p>if a user wished to send a compliment, they would first identify their target by glancing at them until they became "locked". the KUDO system does a really good job at conducting this pairing sequence, meaning one only has to take a quick visual swipe rather than stare.</p>
    <p>once a target is locked, the user would then think of the appropriate concept ("NICE HAIR"), which would be captured and digitally encoded by their brain-implant device. the encoding would be transmitted through something akin to bluetooth (but not as shitty), finally being received and decoded by the target.</p>
    <p>when a user receives a compliment, a little icon pops up near some corner of their eye with the appropriate message. but not all messages need to carry an author; depending on the sender, some messages may be anonymous.</p>
    <p>messages can accept replies, too. if a KUDO user receives a "NICE HAIR" compliment, they can send a compliment back, usually "THANKS" or "YOU TOO". this process is the same as the sending procedure, except the target field is automatically defined by whoever sent the message first.</p>
    <p>one also has the ability to reply to anonymous messages, since all users have a "unique ID" that distinguishes them from other users.</p>
    <p>when the KUDO system is in use, it is common for two strangers to pass each other like usual, yet exchange two quick compliments on the interior. this is the prime use case for KUDO: niceness need not be difficult.</p>
    <p>however, there was a sizable pushback against the KUDO system. dissenters believed thought-driven compliments would kill "real compliments", or those that depended on speech and gestures. they imagined the KUDO system turning everyone into unassertive mutes, with ideas like "thank you" and "have a nice day" relegated to the invisible. to them, KUDO was a perversion of natural social dynamics. the system was far too convenient.</p>
    <p>interestingly, the consequences of KUDO tipped toward the other end. as KUDO users became acclimated to an anonymous culture of niceness, their self-confidence grew. many began to experiment with real displays, smiling at strangers and pointing out nice outfits on the street. sort of in the same vein that pokemon go got people to touch grass, but unlike pokemon go, the effects of KUDO were persistent.</p>
    <p>KUDO simulated an interface to the world, one that lowered the ego barrier to stranger-stranger interaction. it became apparent that the KUDO world was much more comfortable to live in than the real world; in turn, KUDO users began to transform the rules of authentic reality to match the KUDO-reality. niceness was no longer difficult. niceness became the norm.</p>
