    <p>convinced everyone has one odd hobby they refuse to share with anyone else.</p>
    <p>like collecting stainless steel, or night swimming, or the scientific study of clouds, or very small dogs, or meditating at sunrise, or re-engineering sega games for the next generation, or making fantasy maps, or glow-in-the-dark mushrooms, or pointillism, which is the art of painting tiny dots.</p>
    <p>odd hobbies are hard to explain. that's why they're buried deep underground, almost touching the mantle, and they feed off the geothermal heat like an organism. but when they do see the surface once in a million years, they don't look the same at all. it's like drudging up a deep sea fish. the rapid pressure change caused them to sag and turn pink. you probably killed it.</p>
    <p>odd hobbies are the biggest secrets. you tell your friends "i'm going out" or "i'll be busy", but really you're making paper kites, or watching old japanese horror movies, or making fruit syrups, or selling stickers on the internet. we think of secrecy as an act of shame, but really it ought to be an act of pride. no one else deserves to know. it's your own little world untainted.</p>
    <p>if you don't have an odd hobby then you must have an odd interest. something that makes you stop and go "hey, cool" while the world swims on by. you see a million years of history but all they see is a rock. and that makes you the weird one.</p>
    <p>but i think it's fine to like something no one else likes, because that thing you like is now yours to keep. you're the first customer. take care of it.</p>
