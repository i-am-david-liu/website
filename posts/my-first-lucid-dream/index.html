    <hr>
    <p>Had my first lucid dream on Friday. I woke up earlier than usual, so I went back to sleep.</p>
    <p>I found myself suspended over <a href="https://dm0qx8t0i9gc9.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/video/D8qa-2E/city-street-at-night-new-york-city-skyscrapers-buildings-traffic-lights_szssyxmh_thumbnail-1080_01.png">a city</a>. It was a lot darker than the linked picture, and almost none of the windows were lit. The ones that were shone brightly, like flat golden rectangles. Not a single thing moved.</p>
    <p>I thought to myself, "hey, this feels pretty weird." Then I realized I was aware of my thoughts.</p>
    <p>At this point I got super excited because I've never had a lucid dream before. And since I had zero prior experience, I jumped straight in without maintaining control over my dream state. The first (and only) action I took was fly headfirst into a skyscraper. I didn't care what would happen next; I just wanted to exert my newly appointed agency.</p>
    <p>As I approached the building, I heard a deep rumbling noise, and then everything faded to black. I awoke shortly after.</p>
    <p>After a bit of research, I conclude that I <em>probably</em> carried out a <a href="https://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Dreaming%20is%20Personal/WILD.htm">Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream (WILD)</a>. This is when you sleep for about 4-6 hours, wake up briefly, and go back to bed while cultivating a lucid dream state. Needless to say, I wasn't aware of this "cultivating" process, so I must have done it by accident.</p>
    <p>Another thought: most of my clearest dreams occured during secondary sleep cyclesâ€”periods of sleep initiated after waking up in the middle of the night. I don't know how or why this happens, but the mechanisms might be relevant to the WILD technique.</p>
    <p>Lucid dreams are seriously cool, and I envy people who can just "make it work". Definitely taking some notes today or tomorrow on the topic.</p>
