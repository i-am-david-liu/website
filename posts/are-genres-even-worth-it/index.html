    <hr>
    <p>The categorization of music into <em>genres</em> is a hot debate. What ought to count as "rock" or "modern classical" or "new wave" is largely defined by social, historical, and aesthetic components, not an objective checklist of qualities. I mean, music is art! It's not like we're classifying species or programming language paradigms.</p>
    <p>As a music listener, I think about genres a lot, especially when categorizing songs I enjoy listening to. I discovered that traditional genres like rock, pop, jazz, or electronic are suboptimal and refuse to acknowledge the multidimensionality of music. For example, jazz can be high energy or lower energy; complex like Coltrane or inoffensive like Ryo Fukui. To group Coltrane and Fukui into one playlist called "Jazz" makes a disjointed playlist, and to create new playlists that accommodate for multiple dimensions just lead to balkanization. You can never win, so I strayed away from those big names and looked into different schemes.</p>
    <p>One popular alternative involves categorizing songs by mood. Forget about names; if the song makes you want to get up and throw things, they ought to belong in the same category. I particularly like this one, because grouping by mood lets me understand music from an entirely different perspective, one that's decoupled from pretentious identities like "intelligent dance music."</p>
    <p>A more practical scheme groups songs by task: music for studying, music for gaming, music for sleeping, music for dinner parties. Personally, I'm not too big on this, because I feel like tasks are just a subset of moods. I'd rather have a playlist that defines itself as "low energy", which I find covers more ground.</p>
    <p>Once, I stumbled upon a YouTube channel (wasn't able to relocate it, sorry!) that appointed a rather synesthetic grouping based on the <em>color</em> of music. Personally, I understand what it meant for a song to <em>feel</em> gray (shoegaze, field recordings) or red (alternative rock), and the scheme prompted me to re-evaluate my relationship with genres in music.</p>
    <p>Look, genres are great for categorizing archives and getting an <em>idea</em> of what something sounds like, but I don't see any value in relying on what are basically database id tags. I'll stick with my qualia, thank you very much.</p>
    <h3 id="whatidoinstead">What I do instead</h3>
    <p>I have a scheme that categorizes music based on <em>feel</em>. The difference between mood and feel is that <em>feel</em> stands to be more complex and manifold than mood, while also casting a wider net.</p>
    <p>For example, one of my playlists impart a milieu that can only be described as a mental image:</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Looking out of an airplane window, flying low, the white clouds arrange themselves in horizontal lines parallel to your view. The sky is blue, and there is nothing on the ground but farmland."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Most of the songs are electronic, but a few are modern classical, experimental hip hop, vaporwave, plunderphonicsâ€¦you get the idea. I find this playlist ideal for post-sunset cognitive tasks (like writing this post!), but I'm also a big fan of listening to it during cloudy mornings, when the sky takes on a bluish-silver.</p>
    <p>I find it difficult to transmit a perfect summary of what I experience when listening to this playlist, but I can definitely approach one. Let me try again.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Looking out of an airplane window; you're the only one on board. The plane's flying so close to the ground you could carve the trunks from the trees. Up above, the clouds arrange themselves in horizontal lines parallel to your view, like guitar strings. You haven't seen a road in hours."
    </blockquote>
    <p>That's more like it.</p>
