    <p>Many of us have a desire to do less of something, whether it be diet, drug consumption, media consumption, etc. There are several ways to achieve this, but they all require some nugget of mental discipline—a quality that is often a blocker.</p>
    <p>Cold turkey and weaning off are popular methods, but ideally there should be a strategy that's relatively passive and requires low mental effort.</p>
    <p>For the past two years, I've been relying on a simple idea: <em>to do less of something, make it hard to get</em>. Here's an example.</p>
    <p>On sleepy mornings, I habitually reach for my phone and open YouTube to wake myself up. Sometimes I lie in bed for half an hour, scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. It makes me feel horrible, so I decided to delete it.</p>
    <p>The next morning, I'll habitually reach for my phone again and discover I can't watch videos anymore. Now I have three decisions to consider:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Open the App Store and re-download YouTube (too much effort, especially in the morning)</li>
    <li>Go to a fallback app, like <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> or Discord. These two have noticeably less content than YouTube, so my time spent on them is bounded.</li>
    <li>Leave the bed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Without YouTube, my morning process usually goes from (2) to (3). I'm working towards only (3), and I believe a good way of going about this is to set my phone farther away. But that's beyond the scope of this post.</p>
    <p><strong>The central argument:</strong> by making a desire harder to reach, all that extra effort dissuades attaining said desire. One is less likely to grab a beer if it's at the liquor store on the other side of town rather than their fridge.</p>
    <p>Here's another example involving sweets.</p>
    <p>You're free to buy candy, but you must purchase the smallest amount possible. Fun-sized, not party-sized. This renders the candy:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>A sparse resource, incentivizing conservation</li>
    <li>Less economical (you're wasting more money)</li>
    <li>Annoying to re-purchase</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If I were in this situation, I'd end up replacing my candy-need with an easier-to-get alternative, like dried fruit or something. There's no constraint on dried fruit. And I don't think I'd be eating dried fruit like candy, either.</p>
    <h3 id="awarning">A warning</h3>
    <p>Naturally, we might end up gaming the system. One may form a habit of visiting the store every day to buy their pre-planned M&amp;M ration. It's important to have some notion of self-monitoring, such that we can correct our behavior and add more effort when needed. Instead of buying candy at Store A five minutes away, we're restricted to buying candy at Store B twenty minutes away. Only when we really, <em>really</em> need a piece of chocolate or a gummy worm (after a shitty day, maybe) do we develop the motivation to go on a longer trip.</p>
    <p>It's also worth mentioning that if we end up getting used to the new system, then we haven't made it annoying enough. For example, I set a 17-digit passcode on my phone to deter myself from picking it up so often. I hoped the excess cognitive work would create an avoidant behavior, but I ended up developing the muscle memory to render the input sequence trivial (currently, it takes about three seconds to open). An easy fix might be to set new, potentially longer passcodes to "reset" my muscle memory and make the lock screen more painful to access. Or I can broaden to alphanumeric passwords; the tiny phone keyboard is always annoying to get right.</p>
    <p>Those are possible solutions, but they aren't elegant, and they sort of break the "low mental effort" condition for this strategy. But again—out of scope.</p>
